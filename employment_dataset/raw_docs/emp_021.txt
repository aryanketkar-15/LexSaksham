Dear [Staff member name]
Unsuccessful completion of probationary period
I am writing to confirm the discussion which we had on [date].
As you are aware, your employment with the organisation was subject to a probationary period.  Unfortunately your performance has not reached a satisfactory standard during your probationary period.  Your probationary period ends on [date] and it has been decided to terminate your employment at this point.
When leaving the organisation you must ensure that you return all company property [list items – eg books, laptop, phone, security pass].
I am sorry that we have had to reach this conclusion, and I wish you every success in the future.
Kind regards



[name and position]
