FOREWORD 
 
 
The Security Manual for private companies involved in the production of defence 
products is  issued in pursuance of para 12 of the Press Note No.2(2002 series) issued by the 
Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, 
Government of India. Presently, licensed defence companies are required to put in place 
adequate safety and security procedures once licence is granted and production 
commences and this would be subject to verifications by authorized Government agencies.  
 
2. 
The Industrial Licence is issued by DIPP, in terms of the Rule 15(2) of the Registration 
and Licensing of Industries Undertaking Rules framed under Industries (Development & 
Regulation) Act 1951.  The Industrial Licence contains a Footnote to the effect that detailed 
instructions issued by the Ministry of Defence (Department of Defence Production) from 
time to time in regard to conditions stipulated in the Industrial Licence in terms of Para 12 & 
15 of the Press Note 2 (2002 series) on adequate safety and security procedures to be put in 
place by the licensee and on sale of defence items produced under the industrial licence 
shall also be followed by the licensee for strict compliance.  This Security Manual therefore, 
is issued for compliance by licensed defence companies in the private sector as a part of the 
licensing conditions prescribed in the Industrial License. 
 
3. 
This Security Manual prescribes minimum standards of security and other safeguards 
required to be put in place by the licensee in the interest of national safety and security.  
Specific attention in this regard is also drawn to the Official Secrets Act 1923, particularly 
Section 2(a) thereof which defines “prohibited place”.  All units/ offices/ areas of licensed 
defence industries in the private sector dealing with any classified information/ document/ 
material are also “prohibited places” in terms of the provisions of the Official Secrets Act, 
1923. 
 
4. 
Indian Licensed Defence Companies can also have additional security safeguards over 
and above those prescribed in this Manual, specific to their requirements as considered 
necessary.  The Government (MoD, IB, MHA, etc) may also prescribe additional safeguards, 
if required, in any particular case and such safeguards would also be required to be followed 
by the company.  Any violation/ non-adherence to any such instructions would be liable for 
action under the relevant Act/ Rule/ Guidelines. 
 
5. 
The companies would be required to follow this Security Manual whenever they 
undertake the manufacturing of any Defence item for which they have been issued 
Industrial Licence.  The security instructions relating to the category to which the Defence 
product belongs, would be applicable in such case. 
 
6. 
Defence products would be categorized in three categories such as A, B & C, as 
illustrated below.  Category A would involve products which require highest level of 

9 
 
security, category B would involve a medium level of security and category C would require 
a minimum level of security.  If any company is involved in the manufacturing of the 
Defence products which lie in more than one category, then either the company should 
clearly segregate the areas of operation/ manufacturing for different categories of products 
and apply the related security instructions or if the areas of operation/ manufacture are not 
possible to be segregated, the security instructions applicable to the higher level of security 
would be applied. 
 
Category - A : 
The products involved in this category would be highly classified and 
sensitive from the security angle and the manufacturing of these items would require the 
highest level of security.   The illustrative examples of products under this category are   
explosives, propellants, propulsion, aircrafts, warships, battle tanks, radars, weapons, 
software and various types of charges.   
 
Category - B 
: 
This category would include semi-finished products, sub-assemblies, 
sub-systems of main weapons/ equipments/ platforms and some finished products of lesser 
degree of sensitivity.  The illustrative examples of products under this category are wing 
assemblies/ structural assemblies/ barrel assemblies/ turret/ avionics etc. 
 
Category - C 
: 
This category would include products which do not involve use of any 
classified/ secret information and are very generic in nature.  The products in this category 
would normally be not specifically designed or modified for military use and therefore 
would require only a very minimal level of security.  The illustrative examples of products 
under this category are sub-assembly components, sheet metal parts, all other C class items 
& consumables. 
 
7. 
The companies which have already been issued licence for manufacturing defence 
items and have already started manufacturing defence items, will have to put in place the 
necessary Security Systems as prescribed in the manual within a period of 1 year from the 
date of Notification of this manual.   
 
8. 
Immediately after this Security Manual comes into force, IB/ MHA would undertake 
the first security audit of all the licensed private companies in the Defence sector and based 
on the experience/ feedback of IB/ MHA, the Security Manual may be revised, if required.  
The Security Manual may be revised every two years after consultation with the MHA, IB, 
Armed Forces, Industry, etc. 
 
9. 
Category of security required for a particular company will be specified along with the 
comments of DDP on IL applications received from DIPP.  For existing licence holders, they 
will be addressed separately about the applicable category.  DDP will also put the list of 
defence products category wise on its website.

CHAPTER – 6 
Communication Security 
 
6.1 
All communications are vulnerable to interception. Security of Communication is, 
therefore of paramount importance in an organization. 
 
6.2 
Telephones.  
 
6.2.1 No form of telephonic conversation, including intercom PAX and hot lines, is 
secure. Every care has to be taken to prevent inadvertent leakage of 
classified information by discussing classified matters over the telephone. 
Following precautions shall be observed:- 
 
(a)  
TOP SECRET, SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL information should not be 
passed or discussed on telephone. 
 
(b)  
Before answering the phone or passing any official information on 
telephone, the person receiving the call should identify the caller 
beyond any reasonable doubt. In case of doubt, caller should be asked 
to give telephone no. and identity, which should be checked with the 
directory before calling back the caller. 
 
(c)  
To prevent misuse, telephones, they should be kept locked when the 
officer is away from his office. 
 
(d) 
Cordless phones will not be used. 
 
(e) 
If it comes to notice that an intruder has come on the line and some 
information has come to the knowledge of the listener, the same 
should be brought to the notice of senior officers and CCSO so that 
remedial measures can be taken. 
 
(f) 
A thorough physical check of the PABX phones or instruments or 
boxes should be made periodically by the office of CCSO to ensure 
that these are not tampered with. 
 
(g) 
All vulnerable points in the intercom system should be protected by 
wooden or metallic boxes with locking arrangement. 
 

53 
 
(h) 
Telephone conversation is totally unsafe; thus, if at all classified 
information has to be passed on phone, proper secrecy device should 
be used. 
 
(i) 
All telephones should be provided with a caller ID facility. 
 
(j) 
Only authorized person be nominated for maintenance of PAX / 
outdoor plant, furthermore records of same be maintained. 
 
6.3 
Cell or Mobile Phones  / Data Cards / Voice Modems 
 
6.3.1 Cellular or Mobile Phone / Data Cards / Voice Modems are highly insecure 
medium for communication purposes, since it works on UHF and VHF and is 
prone to interception by Frequency Modulation receivers.  These gadgets can 
also be used as effective, unobtrusive listening devices for eavesdropping. 
Technology now exists where the eavesdropping function can be carried out 
even with they are in switched off mode and can be used to shoot and 
transmit still pictures or live videos. Therefore, cellular or mobile phones / 
Data Cards / Voice Modems including WLL phones are potent sources of 
breach of security of information. Also, no technology or device exists which 
can be fitted on them to make it interception proof. 
 
6.3.2 GSM Monitoring system is a commercial off the shelf (COTS) equipment and 
is being manufactured by a large number of original equipment 
manufacturers (OEMs) across the world. Available equipments enable 
monitoring of Communication from briefcase sized equipment. A number of 
Indian vendors are marketing GSM monitoring systems. Due to their small 
size and portability, there is threat that inimical agencies may selectively 
employ such means/gadgets for interception of cellular communication from 
high density areas/ 
specific areas of activity. 
 
6.3.3 The use of Cell phone shall be banned in areas/offices wherein classified work 
is in progress/documents are being worked upon. On special cases 
permission to carry mobile phones by critical staff, in these areas shall be 
recommended by the Head of department and granted by CCSO.  Mobile 
phones are not permitted inside conference halls, operations rooms, at 
official briefings and at sensitive places even in off mode. This instruction is 
applicable to even those who have been permitted. Mobile phone with 
camera and other technical advance features including internet, GSM, etc 
should not be allowed irrespective of ranks inside the office premises.  No 

54 
 
visitors will be permitted to carry mobiles inside the facility, the mobiles of 
visitors is to be deposited at the reception.  
 
6.4 
FAX communications. FAX communications are also vulnerable to interception or 
leakage, e.g.  a cross-connection. It is, therefore, necessary to identify the end party 
before transmitting a message. Papers which are not of classified or sensitive nature 
may be transmitted with the help of FAX in emergent cases. Under no circumstances 
such an option is exercised for transmitting classified documents. No classified 
message should be passed or received on Fax on auto mode. 
 
6.4.1 While using Fax machines a record of the documents or papers faxed or 
received will be kept in a register. The record will include the following 
details:- 
 
(a) 
Time of Fax sent or received. 
 
(b) 
Title of document. 
 
(c) 
Number of pages 
 
(d) 
Sent to or received from. 
 
(e) 
Designation of Officers or office where Fax is sent. 
 
(f) 
Officer authorized to dispatch the Fax.  
 
 
(g) 
No “ Top Secret” message should be transmitted on FAX. 

55 
 
CHAPTER – 7 
Computer and Cyber Security 
 
7.1 
General 
 
7.1.1 Information systems (IS) that are used to capture, create, store, process or 
distribute classified information must be properly managed to protect against 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information, loss of data and integrity to 
ensure the availability of the data and system. 
7.1.2 The organization must, at all times, be in strict compliance with the IT Act 
2000, as amended in 2008 and as amended from time to time. 
7.1.3  Protection requires a balanced approach in IS security features to include, but 
not 
limited 
to, 
administrative, 
operational, 
physical, 
computer, 
communications and personal controls. Protective measures commensurate 
with the classification of information, the threat and the operational 
requirement associated with environment of IS. 
7.1.4 ILDC management should appoint / nominate Cyber Information Security 
Officer clearly defined with roles and responsibilities to carry out activities 
like development, implementation and evaluation of the facility IS program.    
To publish and promulgate IS security policy and procedures to address 
classified processing environment. The CISO function may be accomplished 
by one senior officer with adequate computer knowledge in addition to his / 
her job. 
7.1.5  Threats to Computers security could emanate from internal sources such as 
subverted/disgruntled employees, as well from external sources such as the 
vendors of the Hardware/ Software, outsider maintenance staff or from 
intruders/hackers in the Cyber Space and hostile foreign countries /inimical 
agencies. Threats can manifest as Structured (automated methods of 
information gathering and attack - organised, determined and goal centric) or 
unstructured (network loitering, manual information gathering or attack and 
misuse by accident). Some of the Computer vulnerabilities that exist are as 
follows:- 
 
(a) 
Physical theft of Hard disks, Computer Storage Media, Keyboards with 
memory facility, used Printer Cartridges, Laptops etc. 
 
(b) 
Stealing /compromising data /information by remote access. 
 

56 
 
(c) 
Accidental/Intentional cross connection between the Organization 
Local Area Network and Internet. 
 
(d) 
Spoofing by intruders. 
 
(e) 
Defacing of various Websites by anonymous Hackers. 
 
7.2 
ISO 27001: 
 
7.2.1 The companies shall follow guidelines under ISO 27001. Appropriate controls 
shall be implemented to accommodate the guidelines given in this manual. 
 
7.2.2 This International Standard has been prepared to provide a model for 
establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining 
and improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). 
 
7.2.3 This International Standard adopts a process approach for establishing, 
operating, 
monitoring, 
reviewing, 
maintaining 
and 
improving 
an 
organization’s ISMS. 
 
7.2.4 The process approach for information security management presented in this 
International Standard encourages its users to emphasize the importance of: 
a) 
Understanding an organization’s information security requirements 
and the need to establish policy and objectives for information 
security; 
b) 
Implementing and operating controls to manage an organization’s 
information security risks in the context of the organization’s overall 
business risks; 
c) 
Monitoring and reviewing the performance and effectiveness of the 
ISMS;  and  
d) 
Continual improvement based on objective measurement. 
7.2.5 This International standard adopts the “Plan-Do-Check-Act” (PDCA) model, 
which is applied to structure all ISMS processes.  
7.2.6 Norms of ISO 27001 is the comprehensive evaluation of the technical and 
non-technical security features of an IS and other safeguards, made as part of 
and in support of the accreditation process, to establish the extent to which a 
particular design and implementation meet a specified set of security 

57 
 
requirements. The compliance process subjects the system to appropriate 
verification that protection measures have been correctly implemented. The 
internal system shall review that all systems have the appropriate protection 
measures in place and validate that they provide the protection intended.  
 
7.3 
The information security policy must take into account the information systems 
deployed by the organization as well as by any sub contractors, where such systems 
may have an impact of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of systems / data. 
This policy must be made based on a realistic vulnerability / threat and risk 
assessment by qualified information  security experts. The policy must have sign off 
from the senior most management of the organisation. If the organization also holds 
Critical Information Infrastructure, the Policy must be made in consultation with 
NCIIPC. The policy must cover all information devices and, inter alia, include 
Implementation of Security Controls as released by NCIIPC / CERT-In e.g. 
 
 
(a)  
Hardware / software inventory and controls 
(b)  
Protection against malware 
(c)  
User and Password management including for all users handling 
critical / sensitive information including sub contractors. 
(d)  
Revocation of privileges subsequent to termination of employees / 
contracts 
(e)  
Safe and verified backup and restoration mechanisms. These must be 
tested on a regular basis. 
 
7.3.1 Having implemented adequate measures to secure their information 
infrastructure, the CISO must also ensure that compensating controls and 
residual risk are enumerated and sign off obtained from management. 
 
7.3.2 Some common Requirements are: 
 
(a)  General User and Privileged users, their roles, responsibility and 
accountability should be clearly defined 
 
(b)  Require that each IS privilege / general user sign an acknowledgement 
of responsibility to adhere to Information security guidelines. 
 
c)  
Profiling of Information assets based on sensitivity of information by the 
Level of Concern for Confidentiality (C), System Availability (A) and Data 
integrity (I).The level of concern reflects the sensitivity of the 
information and the consequences of the loss of (CAI) confidentiality, 
integrity or availability. Based on these matrices, need for protection 

58 
 
levels and profiles in the form of security, audit, redundancy in the 
infrastructure, backup etc., shall be determined. 
 
(d)  Procedures should be defined about unique identification of user, user 
id removal on termination, transfer; change in roles etc., re-use of user 
id and user id revalidation for the use of any centralised IS resource. 
 
(e)  To maintain the CIA , control and audit logging mechanism along with 
monitoring system should be in place, for changes to data includes 
deterring, detecting and reporting of successful and unsuccessful 
attempts to change etc., 
 
(f) 
Control 
and 
audit 
logs 
should 
be 
available 
in 
centralised 
systems/applications for Successive Logon Attempts, Multiple Logon 
Control, Session termination and User Inactivity etc., 
 
(g)  
Security should be ensured for inter connectivity of multiple LANs, 
when organisation has multiple Units/Offices across the geographical 
location, where interconnectivity may be WAN (Wide Area Network) 
using public networks. 
 
(h)  When Public networks are used proven, secured WAN technologies 
should be used along with appropriate security at the gateway and 
suitable encryption during transmission. 
 
(i)    Proper system should be in place to track, inventories, to carry out OS 
patches, IOS/Firmware updates and Configuration Management of 
information Systems.  
 
(j)  
All Internet facing Web sites /Applications, necessary protections at 
Network Layer and Application, like security during transmission, 
Application Security and Database security should be in place by using 
appropriate security components / measures.  
 
(k) 
The Number of Internet Connections shall be controlled by CEO/ Head 
of Company as per the company policy. 
 
(l) 
Centralised Anti Virus management solution should be in place for 
effective implementation of Anti Virus solution. 
 

59 
 
(m) 
System should be in place for internal incident management as well as 
for implementation of time to time necessary guidelines / measures 
from Computer Emergency Response Team – India (CERT-India)/ 
National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC); 
and should be able to detect any violations to existing policies and 
ensure updating IT infrastructure. 
 
(n) It is emphasized that the above are indicative and not exhaustive. It is for 
each organization and its management to ensure that due diligence is 
undertaken in protecting the organizational cyber assets, as well as any 
sensitive applications / information that may be handled by sub 
contractors 
 
7.4 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP):  should be implemented as system integrates 
internal and external management information across the entire organization, 
tracking of all processes, materials and personnel in the plant. ERP systems automate 
this activity with an integrated software application. The purpose of ERP is to 
facilitate the flow of information between all business functions inside the 
boundaries of the organization and manage the connections to outside stakeholders. 
There should be exhaustive guidelines, operating procedures issued for all aspects of 
plant functioning. Ownership of all processes and inventory held should be clearly 
defined with standby ownership. 
 
7.5 
Physical and Software Security.   
 
7.5.1 Unless the physical security of a computer system is ensured, any attempt to 
protect its operations and data will be futile. Physical security and safeguard 
of hardware from damage, theft and unauthorized access and software and 
data from intentional, accidental or environmental corruption must be 
ensured at all costs.  
 
7.5.2 Safeguarding the computer storage media, software, sensitive and 
proprietary data by:- 
 
(i)  
Safekeeping of computer storage media, (CDs, magnetic tapes, hard 
disk, USB drives etc). 
 
(ii)  
Shredding or secure disposal of console logs or printouts, used printer 
ribbons & carbons, damaged  tapes and hard disks etc. 
 

60 
 
(iii) 
Protection of Switches/Routers and other connectivity devices. 
 
7.5.3 Adequate protection is required both for the operating system software and 
application software. In order to prevent unauthorized access to the data, 
passwords should be assigned at multiple levels i.e. first at the time of 
making the system operational, second at the time of logging with the 
authorized user's name, third at the time of running application software and 
so on, depending upon the type of data being handled. It is very essential 
that there should be a provision of 'Audit Trail' features to know which user 
had logged in and at what time.  
 
7.6 
Acquisition of Computer hardware and Software 
 
7.6.1 Computer hardware, which is proposed to be procured, should be of an open 
system or architecture and the user should be free to go in for 'Annual 
Maintenance Contract’ with any party. The systems being procured should be 
the latest ones which can be upgraded at a later date. 
 
7.6.2 If development of software application is outsourced, antecedents of the 
personnel/company developing the software should be verified. Where 
necessary, Non Disclosure Agreements (NDA’s) must be signed by the 
Contractor / sub contractors. Further, for critical applications the vendor 
should be asked to provide source code for the application developed by him. 
Whenever feasible, dummy data should be used for testing the applications. 
This would prevent the vendor from accessing sensitive information. 
 
7.6.3 The firms, which are offering AMC, should be positively vetted by CISO (with 
help from SIB/ Cyber Crime Cell of local police / MOD/ IB if so required) 
before they are allowed to take up Software & Hardware maintenance work. 
In case the same is not possible, an audit of the firm from security point of 
view should be carried out. While awarding contract for maintenance it 
should be ensured that too many engineers from the maintenance company

Instead of multiple internet connections, there should be limited 
internet gateways for accessing the internet from within the 
organisation. These limited internet connections must be closely 
monitored by the Information Security Operations Centre of the 
organization.  
 
ii) 
All traffic through the organisational internet gateways must be 
screened to ensure that organizational data remains secure. 
Concerned personnel must be sensitized to the fact that their internet 
connections are provided to aid them in discharge of their duties and 
not for personal usage. 
 
iii) 
Communication through open e-mail for disseminating information 
related to the equipment being used or quantity to be manufactured 
or its component details at any stage (from development, testing to 

102 
 
deployment) to its joint partners (contractors /sub-contractors) 
should be avoided. 
 
 
iv) 
If the joint venture involves collaboration of foreign firm(s) then, 
connectivity of their computers with contractor system needs to be 
examined from security angle. 
 
v) 
All employees should be barred from using private email addresses 
(like gmail, hotmail, yahoo, rediffmail, etc) for any form of official 
communication and emails from suppliers/contractors through 
private emails addressees should be barred, as far as possible. 
 
vi) 
Social media usage policy should be defined and enforced on all 
employees. Unless specifically required for discharge of their duties, 
employees must be prohibited from accessing social media sites from 
their official systems. Employees should be discouraged from

specifications approved, after the development of prototype. Indian Navy will
formulate the trial directives and constitute the Trial Team. The ‘tial directive’ wil
‘specify the fundamental points that need to be addressed for validating the
‘essential’ parameters. The validation of the support system and maintainability
trials, integral to and complimenting the trial programme of the defence equipment!
upgrades! product! system will be held simultaneously, wherever feasible. The user
can recommend modification to the system for ease of handling and its
‘maintainability. Based on the User Trials, the Indian Navy would carry out a Staff
Evaluation, which gives the compliance of the demonstrated performance of the
‘equipment vis-a-vis the SQRs. On acceptance of Staff evaluation report, the SQRs
shall from the basis for the ‘Buy (Indian-IDDM) category of acquisition. If the
prototype of only a single firmiindividual clears the trials will be progressed as
resultant single vendor.

(€)* Finalisation of SERs. PFT wil facials the finalisation of SE Rs based on
inputs from the Development Agencies (DAS) during the development stage, prior
to commencement of user trials. The SQRs of the equipment would thereafter be a
part of the trial directives, and only the essential parameters as detailed in the SORs
wil be tested

()__ Solicitation of Commercial Offers. A commercial ‘Request for Proposal’

(RFP) for ‘Buy (Indian-IDDMY' phase, will be issued to all DAs for submission of
their commercial offer prior to commencement of User tials.

(9) Award of Contract. Commercial Offers of only those vendors will be
‘opened whose equipment has been short-listed consequent to Staff Evaluation and
the L1 bidder would be determined based on the provisions of the Commercial RFP

PREAMBLE TO THE DEFENCE ACQUISITION PROCEDURE 
 
1. 
Defence Acquisition Procedure is based on the concept of “Womb to “Tomb” and has 
certain unique aspects such as supplier constraints, technological complexity, foreign suppliers, 
high cost, foreign exchange implications and geo-political ramifications, and therefore is not a 
standard open market commercial form of procurement. While maintaining highest standards of 
transparency, probity and public accountability, a balance between competing requirements such 
as expeditious procurement, high quality standards and appropriate costs needs to be established. 
As a result, decision making pertaining to defence acquisition remains distinctive and complex. 
 
2. 
Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan clarion call given by the Hon’ble Prime Minister, further 
accentuated by Policy Reforms in the Defence Sector as part of Phase IV ‘New Horizons of 
Growth’ are focussed towards enhancing self reliance in defence production, indigenisation of 
spares, overhauling of Trial and Testing procedures based on realistic Services Qualitative 
Requirements and requisite monitoring by Project Management Unit (PMU) for time bound 
procurement. There is a need to institute enabling provisions for utilisation and consolidation of 
design, development and manufacturing infrastructure available in the country. A need has also 
been felt, for identifying strategic partners for promoting defence production in the private 
sector. The visionary FDI policy statement of enhancing FDI through automatic route from 49% 
to 74% in defence will enable in making ‘Manufacture in India’ a lucrative option for foreign 
equipment manufacturers. 
 
3. 
DAP 2020 focuses on simplifying the Defence acquisition procedure and 
institutionalising monitoring mechanism with concurrent actions using digital technologies & 
data base for selection of best equipment in a transparent and competitive manner giving 
adequate opportunities to capable vendors. Make in India initiative of the Government of India 
focuses on increasing participation of Indian Vendors including MSMEs, and therefore “Make” 
procedure has been further refined in DAP 2020 to make it more objective and time bound with 
focus on Indian industry especially MSMEs. Cutting down permissible timeframes for various 
activities and institutionalising robust mechanisms to monitor for probity at various stages of the 
acquisition process are the attributes of this DAP. 
 
4. 
While the Defence Acquisition involves long gestation periods, where as the needs of the 
Armed Forces being non negotiable, flexibility in the procedure has been provisioned for, to 
ensure timely availability of important equipment. Thus, the DAP favours swift decision making, 
provides for suitable timelines and delegates powers to the appropriate authorities to ensure an 
efficient and effective implementation of the acquisition process, by all stakeholders concerned.  
 
5. 
DAP 2020, a product of extensive analysis, deliberations, interactions and focused 
formulations, aims to further ‘Self Reliance’ of the country in the defence sector and implement 
‘Ease of Doing Business’ with emphasis on Simplification, Delegation, Reduced Timelines and 
making the process as Industry friendly as possible. Separate chapters have been formulated to 
incorporate specialised acquisition through the DRDO/OFB/DPSUs, procurements related to 
Information and Communication Technology Systems, enable Leasing of equipment as also 
address issues related to Post Contract Management.

CHAPTER I 
 
ACQUISITION CATEGORIES, ACQUISITION PLANNING  
AND INDIGENOUS CONTENT 
 
1. 
Aim. 
The aim of the Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP), erstwhile Defence 
Procurement Procedure (DPP), is to ensure timely acquisition of military equipment, systems 
and platforms as required by the Armed Forces in terms of performance, capabilities and 
quality standards, through optimum utilisation of allocated budgetary resources. While 
enabling the same, DAP will provide for the highest degree of probity, public accountability, 
transparency, fair competition and level-playing field. In addition, self-reliance in defence 
equipment production and acquisition will be steadfastly pursued as a focus of the DAP with 
an ultimate aim to develop India as a global defence manufacturing hub. 
 
2. 
Scope. 
 
 
(a) 
The DAP will cover all Capital Acquisitions other than Works and Land 
undertaken by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and Service Headquarters (SHQ) both 
from indigenous sources and ex-import, except for medical equipment. SHQ for the 
purpose of DAP would include HQ Integrated Defence Staff, Integrated HQ of the 
MoD (Army), Integrated HQ of the MoD (Navy), Integrated HQ of the MoD (Air 
Force) and the Indian Coast Guard. Defence Research and Development Organisation 
(DRDO), Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) and Defence Public Sector Undertakings 
(DPSUs) will, however, continue to follow their own procurement procedure. 
 
(b) 
In the event of enactment of new legislation or change or amendment or 
enforcement of any Act or Law or Policy, rules or regulations or guidelines of MoD 
or Government of India or body such as Chief Vigilance Commission (CVC), which 
becomes effective after the date of last amendment to this DAP, the same will 
automatically be deemed as replacement to the one referred to in this DAP. 
 
Capital Acquisitions 
 
3. 
Definition. 
Acquisition of goods and services which are booked under the Capital 
Budget Head will follow the procedure as laid down in the DAP and will be termed as 
‘Capital Acquisitions’. However, if the SHQ wishes to procure goods and services from the 
Capital Budget through any other procedure, specific approval of the Defence Acquisition 
Council (DAC) may be obtained for each such case. 
 
4. 
Capital Acquisition schemes are broadly classified as, ‘Buy’, ‘Buy and Make’, 
Leasing, ‘Make’, ‘Design and Development (D & D) and Strategic Partnership Model 
(SPM). Other Capital Procurement Procedure (OCPP) may be followed for overhaul, 
major refits, upgrades and replacement of items of Capital nature. Under the ‘Buy’ 
scheme procurements are categorised as ‘Buy (Indian - IDDM)’, ‘Buy (Indian)’, and ‘Buy 

2 
 
(Global)’. Under the ‘Buy and Make’ scheme, the procurements are categorised as ‘Buy and 
Make (Indian)’ and Buy (Global - Manufacture in India). 
 
5. 
Priority of Categorisation. Acquisition of defence equipment under this procedure 
will be based on the above-mentioned categories. The categories, except Make, Leasing, D & 
D and SPM, have been prioritised based on their relative importance towards indigenisation. 
However, there is no embargo on a vendor qualifying in a higher category to participate in 
the lower category in case all requirements of the lower category are met. In decreasing order 
of priority, the priority of categories will be as follows: - 
 
(a) 
Buy (Indian – Indigenously Designed Developed and Manufactured) i.e. Buy 
(Indian-IDDM). 
 
(b) 
Buy (Indian). 
 
(c) 
Buy and Make (Indian). 
 
(d) 
 Buy (Global - Manufacture in India). 
 
(e) 
 Buy (Global). 
 
6. 
Weapons/Platforms Banned for Import. With a view to promote domestic and 
indigenous industry as also align the DAP with the reforms enunciated in the ‘Atmanirbhar 
Bharat Abhiyan’, the MoD has notified a list of weapons/platforms banned for import, as 
updated from time to time on the MoD website and guidelines thereon, and SHQ will ensure 
that no weapon/platform figuring on the list is procured ex import. These equipment may, 
therefore, be procured under the Buy (Indian - IDDM), Buy (Indian), Buy and Make (Indian) 
(only if Buy quantities are zero) and Buy (Global - Manufacture in India) (only if Buy 
quantities are zero) categories of acquisition. 
 
7. 
In addition to the above listed categorisation, the Make, D & D and SPM 
categorisations aim at developing long-term indigenous defence capabilities. Depending 
upon factors such as Indian industry’s capability, access to technology, time frame required 
and available for development, the Make and D & D category of acquisition would be 
pursued in isolation, in sequence or in tandem with any of the five categories under ‘Buy’ or 
‘Buy and Make’ classifications, with a separate heading under Defence Capital Acquisition 
Plan (DCAP) and Annual Acquisition Plan (AAP). 
 
Definition of Acquisition Categories 
 
8. 
Buy (Indian-IDDM). ‘Buy (Indian-IDDM)’ category refers to the acquisition of 
products from an Indian vendor that have been indigenously designed, developed and 
manufactured with a minimum of 50% Indigenous Content (IC) on cost basis of the base 
contract price i.e. total contract price less taxes and duties.  

3 
 
 
(a) 
The Request For Information (RFI), incorporating questions to confirm that 
the equipment has been indigenously designed and developed, shall be formulated by 
SHQ, in consultation with DRDO and/or other experts from IIT/IISc and other 
Government agencies. Post receipts of responses from interested vendors, a 
Committee convened by SHQ shall examine the responses received from vendors and 
recommend categorisation as ‘Buy (Indian – IDDM). The Committee shall also 
recommend documentation and other requirements which the vendor shall have to 
submit with their technical bids. 
 
(b) 
These documents and other requirements to be produced by the vendor along 
with the technical bid shall be specified in the Request For Proposal (RFP) and shall be 
scrutinised at the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) stage. Vendors should also 
furnish an undertaking (format attached at Appendix A) for their claim to indigenous 
design. The TEC may include a DRDO representative/ other experts from IIT/IISc 
and other Government agencies to verify vendor claims of indigenous design only. 
However, on a case to case basis, TEC may carry out on site verification to ascertain 
any aspect of the vendor’s claims on indigenous design and development.  
 
9. 
Buy (Indian). 
‘Buy (Indian)’ category refers to the acquisition of products from an 
Indian vendor which may not have been designed and developed indigenously, having 60% 
IC on cost basis of the base contract price. Vendors eligible in ‘Buy (Indian-IDDM)’ category 
will also be permitted to participate in this category with indigenous design and a minimum 
of 50% IC on cost basis of the base contract price. 
 
10. 
Buy and Make (Indian). 
‘Buy & Make (Indian)’ category refers to an initial 
acquisition of equipment in Fully Formed (FF) state in quantities as considered necessary, 
from Indian vendor(s) engaged in a tie-up with a foreign Original Equipment Manufacturer 
(OEM), followed by indigenous production in a phased manner involving Transfer of 
Technology (ToT) of critical technologies as per specified range, depth and scope from the 
foreign OEM. Under this category of acquisition, a minimum of 50% IC is required on cost 
basis of the Make portion of the contract less taxes and duties.  Acquisition under this 
category can also be carried out without any initial procurement of equipment in FF state. 
  
11. 
Buy (Global - Manufacture in India). 
Buy (Global - Manufacture in India) 
category refers to an outright purchase of equipment from foreign vendors, in quantities as 
considered necessary, followed by indigenous manufacture of the entire/part of the 
equipment and spares/assemblies/sub-assemblies/Maintenance along with Repair and 
Overhaul (MRO) facility (only in cases these are part of the main contract) for the 
equipment, through its subsidiary in India/through a Joint Venture/through an Indian 
Production Agency (PA) (with ToT of critical technologies as per specified range, depth and 
scope to the Indian PA), meeting a minimum of 50% IC on cost basis of the Base Contract 
Price. Indian vendors will be permitted to participate in Buy (Global - Manufacture in India). 
Acquisition under this category can also be carried out without any initial procurement of 

4 
 
equipment in FF state. All payments for the ‘Manufactured’ portion will be paid to the vendor 
in Indian Rupees as per contract provisions.  
 
 12. 
Buy (Global). 
‘Buy (Global)’ category refers to outright purchase of equipment 
from foreign or Indian vendors. In case of procurement through foreign vendors, 
Government to Government (G2G) route/Inter Government Agreement (IGA) may also be 
adopted, for equipment meeting strategic/long term requirements. An Indian Vendor 
participating in this category would be required to meet minimum 30% IC, failing which 
such vendor would be required to discharge offsets as applicable in the case. Foreign vendors 
will need to discharge offsets in all Buy (Global) cases with Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) 
cost of ₹ 2000 crores or more, other than all ab-initio Single Vendor Cases, including 
procurements based on IGA/FMS. 
 
13. 
Participation in Lower Category. Vendors eligible for participating in a higher 
category will be permitted to participate in the lower category, provided they meet the 
requirements for the same.  
 
14. 
Applicability of Offsets. 
The Offsets clause would be applicable for Buy 
(Global) categories of procurement where the estimated AoN cost is ₹ 2000 crores or more. 
An Indian Vendor participating in the Buy (Global) category would be required to meet 
minimum 30% IC, failing which such vendor would be required to discharge offsets as 
applicable in the case. In certain cases, the DAC may consider partial or full waiver of the 
Offsets clause. In case of a waiver for a particular acquisition case, eligible/selected Indian 
vendors need not be exempted from the corresponding IC stipulations. No offsets will be 
applicable in all ab-initio Single Vendor Cases, including procurements based on IGA/FMS. 
  
15. 
Make and Innovation. 
Acquisitions covered under the Make and Innovation 
including Innovation in Defence Excellence (iDEX) and Technology Development Fund 
(TDF) categories refer to equipment/system/sub-system/assembly/sub-assembly, major 
components, or upgrades thereof, to be designed, developed and manufactured by an Indian 
vendor/processed by the Services through their internal organisations, such as Base 
Workshop/Dockyards/ Base Repair Depots etc. with or without participation of Private 
industry, as per procedure and norms in Chapter III. 
 
16. 
Design and Development (D & D). 
Design and Development (D & D) 
cases progressed by DRDO/DPSUs/OFB for acquisitions of equipment/system/sub-
system/assembly/sub-assembly, major components, or upgrades thereof, to be designed, 
developed and manufactured by an Indian vendor, will be as per procedure and norms in 
Chapter IV of this DAP. 
 
17. 
Strategic Partnership Model (SPM). 
Acquisitions 
under 
the 
Strategic 
Partnership model refer to participation of private Indian firms along with foreign OEM in 
‘Make in India’ in defence and play the role of a System Integrator by building an extensive 
eco-system comprising development partners, specialised vendors and suppliers, in 

5 
 
particular, those from the MSME sector. Strategic Partnerships will seek to enhance 
indigenous defence manufacturing capabilities through the private sector over and above the 
existing production base. Detailed norms and procedures of the same are as given in Chapter 
VII of this DAP. 
 
18. 
Leasing. 
Leasing has been introduced as another category for acquisition in 
addition to the existing ‘Buy’ and ‘Make’ acquisition categories as it provides for an 
innovative technique for financing of equipment/platforms. Leasing provides means to 
possess and operate the asset without owning the asset and is useful to substitute huge initial 
capital outlays with periodical rental payments. Leasing would be permitted in two sub 
categories i.e. Lease (Indian), where Lessor is an Indian entity and is the owner of the asset, 
and Lease (Global).The procedure for Leasing will be as laid down in Chapter IX of the 
DAP. 
 
19. 
Other Capital Procurement Procedure (OCPP).  
Overhaul, major refits, 
upgrades and replacement of items of Capital nature , will be procured following a 
simplified procedure as laid down in Chapter X of this DAP. 
 
20. 
Definition of Indian Vendor. 
Unless 
specifically 
provided 
for 
in 
a 
clause/section/chapter or elsewhere of the DAP, an Indian Vendor by whatever nomenclature 
when referred to means - for defence products requiring industrial license, an Indian entity, 
which could include incorporation/ownership models as per Companies Act, Partnership 
Firm, Proprietorship and other types of ownership models including Societies as per relevant 
laws, complying with, besides other regulations in force, and the guidelines/licensing 
requirements stipulated by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade 
(DPIIT) as applicable. For defence products not requiring industrial license, an Indian entity 
registered under the relevant Indian laws and complying with all regulations in force 
applicable to that industry will be classified as an Indian Vendor.  The following two 
additional conditions will apply to the definition for Buy(Indian-IDDM), Make I, Make II, 
Development cum Production Partner (DcPP) in D & D acquisitions through 
DRDO/DPSUs/OFB and SP Model categories:- 
 
 
(a) 
Ownership by Resident Indian Citizen(s). Further, a company is considered 
as ‘Owned’ by resident Indian citizens if more than fifty percent (50%) of the capital 
in it is directly or beneficially owned by resident Indian citizens and / or Indian 
companies, which are ultimately owned and controlled by resident Indian citizens. 
This implies that the maximum permitted Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) shall be 
forty nine percent (49%). No pyramiding of FDI in Indian holding companies or in 
Indian entities subscribing to shares or securities of the Applicant Company or the 
Strategic Partner shall be permitted. Indirect foreign investment shall be accounted 
for in counting the forty-nine percent (49%) FDI. 
 
 
(b) 
Control by Resident Indian Citizens(s) (As defined in Companies Act 
2013). ‘Control’ shall include the right to appoint majority of the directors or to 

6 
 
control the management or policy decisions including by virtue of their shareholding 
or management rights or shareholders agreements or voting agreements. 
 
21. 
Indigenous Content (IC). 
For IC referred to in Paragraphs 8–12(Chapter I) and 
stipulated in the RFP for Strategic Partnership model cases, the vendor will ensure 
compliance as detailed in Appendix B to Chapter I. The category wise (less Strategic 
Partnership model cases) summary of IC as per cost of the Base Contract Price (i.e. Total 
Contract Price less taxes and duties) will be as under: - 
 
Ser  
Category 
IC 
(a) 
Buy (Indian-IDDM) 
Indigenous design and ≥ 50% 
(b) 
Buy (Indian) 
In case of indigenous design ≥ 50%, 
otherwise≥ 60% 
(c) 
Buy and Make (Indian) 
≥ 50% of the ‘Make’ portion 
(d) 
Buy 
(Global 
- 
Manufacture in India) 
≥ 50%  
(e) 
Buy (Global) 
Foreign Vendor – Nil 
Indian Vendor ≥ 30% 
 
22. 
In case where niche technology-based equipment, like in aerospace, with no or 
miniscule availability of desired material in the country, the SHQ may recommend lower IC 
than that stipulated in the category. In such cases, if IC becomes less than 30% IC of the base 
contract price, discharge of Offsets will be applicable. The AoN according authority may 
approve higher or lower threshold of IC than that stipulated for various categories. Detailed 
justification for the same should be submitted while seeking AoN. In cases involving BNE, 
the cost of the BNE will be excluded from the base contract price for the purpose of 
calculating IC. 
 
23. 
Upgrades/Life Extension. 
Cases involving upgrade to ‘in service’ weapon systems 
/equipment/assemblies/sub-assemblies/sub-systems and life extension of ‘in service’ weapon 
systems/equipment will also be covered by this procedure. Categorisation of the proposal 
may be carried out depending on scope, availability of indigenous technology and need for 
seeking critical technologies from foreign vendors. 
 
Acquisition Planning Process  
 
24. 
To address the current and futuristic security needs, the Services will need to engage 
in capability development in a prioritised manner based on long term perspective plan from 
which should flow procurements planned for modernisation of the Services based on Capital 
Acquisition Plans. Proposals for acquisition of capital assets will cover the long-term, 
medium-term and short-term perspectives as under: - 
 

7 
 
 
(a) 
10 years Integrated Capability Development Plan (ICDP). 
 
 
(b) 
Five years Defence Capital Acquisition Plan (DCAP). 
 
 
(c) 
Two years Annual Acquisition Plan (AAP). 
 
25. 
Planning Process. 
The planning process would evolve from the National Security 
Strategy/Guidelines (as and when promulgated) and Raksha Mantri’s Operational Directive. The 
following planning process would be adopted to address the current and future needs of the 
Services: - 
 
(a)    HQ IDS will prepare a 10-year ICDP in consultation with the SHQ, every (five 
years), comprising of two five-year plans. This will be prepared, along with a 
Technology Perspective and Capability Roadmap (TPCR) reflecting the details of 
technologies and capabilities that could be made public for use by the industry. The 
ICDP will be approved by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) prior to 
promulgation. ICDP would be translated into appropriate problem definition 
statements and R&D establishment and industry would be given time and resources 
to enable transition from technology development for testing, trials and production to 
take place.  This would help set the requirements clearly and help in deriving the 
system specifications so that grant of AoN for major systems included in the ICDP, 
take note of the lead times needed to develop, test, evaluate and productionise the 
systems required. 
 
(b)    HQ IDS will thereafter prepare the DCAP based on recommendations of SHQ, 
which will include acquisitions planned for the next five years culled out from the 
ICDP, based on prioritised operational requirements. The DCAP will be approved by 
the DAC prior to promulgation. The ICG Capital Acquisition Plan will be processed 
separately by HQ ICG along with the DCAP for approval of DAC. 
 
(c)     Based on the DCAP, each SHQ shall prepare a two-year roll-on acquisition 
plan, to be called Annual Acquisition Plan (AAP), before the commencement of each 
financial year, which shall form the basis for initiation of every acquisition proposal 
for AoN. The draft AAP will be submitted by the SHQ to HQ IDS by 31st of 
December each year, after obtaining comments of the concerned Joint Secretary & 
Acquisition Managers (JS & AMs), Additional Director Generals (ADGs) Acquisition 
Technical and Finance Managers (FMs) of the MoD (Acquisition). 
 
(d) 
A consolidated AAP will be prepared by HQ IDS along with prioritisation of 
schemes based on the overall financial limits linked to the anticipated budget (limits 
being fixed in consultation with MoD (Fin)). HQ IDS will obtain approval of the AAP 
from Defence Procurement Board (DPB) latest by 15th of March. Approval of DPB 
of AAP in respect of Indian Coast Guard (ICG) will be processed by HQ ICG after 
due prioritisation, for approval of DPB. 

8 
 
 
Annual Acquisition Plan (AAP) 
 
26. 
The AAP will comprise of four sections; Part A will contain a list of all carry-over 
acquisition proposals from the previous year and those for which AoN has been accorded 
during the year, Part B will include acquisition proposals likely to be initiated for AoN in the 
forthcoming year, Part C will list out cases under the ‘Make’ and ‘Design & Development’ 
category and Part D will list out procurements planned under OCPP.  
 
27. 
Acquisition proposals not included in the AAP may also be initiated by SHQs on 
account of unforeseen circumstances and will be included in the relevant section of the AAP 
after grant of AoN. However, AoN for such cases being processed within the overall budget 
estimates as prescribed for AAP. The AAP will be accordingly revised and brought up for 
approval of the DPB as per next scheduled revision. 
 
28. 
 The DPB may also carry out amendments to the AAP, if considered necessary, on 
account of national security requirements, operational urgencies and budgetary provisions or 
any other exigency based on recommendations made by SHQ/HQ IDS/Department of 
Military Affairs (DMA)/MoD (Finance)/Department of Defence (DoD). 
 
29. 
Miscellaneous Issues. 
 
(a) 
Independent External Monitors (IEMs). Complaints arising at any stage 
of the acquisition process could be examined by a panel of nominated IEMs based on 
referral by the MoD (Acquisition)/any other Department of the MoD or suo-moto 
complaints by the vendors/any other agency. The details of the IEMs will be intimated 
in the RFP. The IEMs would submit their report to the Defence Secretary for decision. 
The IEMs will have the following role and duties: - 
 
(i) 
For ensuring the desired transparency and objectivity in dealing with 
the complaints arising out of any tendering process, the matter should be 
examined by the full panel of IEMs jointly as far as possible, who would look 
into the records, conduct an investigation and submit their joint 
recommendations to the MoD (Acquisition). 
 
(ii) 
IEMs should examine the process integrity; they are not expected to 
concern themselves with fixing of responsibility of officers. Complaints 
alleging malafide on the part of any officer of the organisation should be 
looked into by the CVO of the concerned organisation. 
 
(iii) 
The role of IEMs being advisory, would not be legally binding and be 
restricted to advising on issues raised by an intending bidder regarding any 
aspect of the tender which allegedly restricts competition or bias towards some 
bidders. 

9 
 
 
(b) 
Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). 
SMEs from the fields of academia, legal, 
finance or industry associations may be approached at various stages of the 
acquisition cycle. Details of all such interactions will be highlighted in the respective 
minutes/reports as applicable at that particular stage of acquisition. 
 
(c) 
Institutionalised Training of Personnel. 
In order to increase efficiency of 
all entities involved in the acquisition cycle, personnel of SHQ and various 
departments of MoD, including MoD(Finance) associated with the acquisition process 
will be imparted training with regards to the nuances of all acquisition processes at 
training institutions in the country and abroad. Subsequently, formalised training on 
the subject will be planned as part of the curriculum of Indian National Defence 
University (INDU). Industry associations should also conduct training of their 
personnel on the nuances of the Acquisition process and the DAP from time to time. 
 
(d) 
Incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
AI is a rapidly growing 
field of technology with potentially significant implications for national security. HQ 
IDS will examine the possibility of inclusion of AI in various platforms/systems and 
apprise the SHQ of the same from time to time. 
 
(e) 
Military Materials. Indigenous availability of high-end Military Materials 
and Special Alloys is an important facet of self-reliance in defence sector. Guidelines 
for promotion of use of materials already available in the country and development/ 
manufacture of materials for future needs are as follows: - 
 
 
(i) 
Ongoing Projects. 
       In order to promote the use of Military 
Materials known to be available in the country, acquisition projects, other than 
‘Buy Global’ projects, for platforms and major equipment, with substantial 
material component may be examined by SHQ at RFI stage, to ascertain the 
feasibility of using and rewarding use of indigenous materials. In case of ‘Buy 
and Make’ category, if the material is not being manufactured in the country, 
ToT for manufacture of materials may be sought. 
 
 
(ii) 
Development for Future Needs. 
   As an ongoing process to 
achieve phased development/ manufacture of materials within the country for 
use in future projects, DPSU/ PSU platform manufacturers, R&D 
establishments and SHQ are to carry out environment scan and identify 
various materials that can be developed in the country by various methods 
including, but not limited to the following: - 
 
 
(aa) 
Phased development of materials by platform manufacturers 
and R&D establishments through own resources or Indian Industry. 
 
 

10 
 
 
(ab) 
Inclusion of ToT for manufacture and validation of materials in 
licensed manufacture projects by Production Agencies (PAs) or 
suitable Indian Material Manufacturers. 
 
 
(ac) 
Seeking and prioritising/ promoting ToTs for military materials 
against Offsets through Indian industry. 
 
 
(ad) 
Taking up Make or Technology Development Fund (TDF) 
projects for development of materials. 
 
(iii) 
Development For Future Needs of Indian Material Manufacturers. 
Indian Material Manufacturers can identify suitable military materials to meet 
the future requirements and share the details with DPSU/PSU platform 
manufacturers, Research and Development (R & D) establishments and SHQ 
for factoring in their developmental plans. Further, they may take up projects 
under Technology Development Fund (TDF)/iDEX for consideration by 
stakeholders. 
 
(f) 
Indigenous Software. 
In order to leverage the highly developed 
indigenous software expertise existing in the country, it is pertinent that maximum 
equipment should function with indigenous software (certification by the Statutory 
Auditor of the Bidder that the software has been developed within India) driving the 
desired applications while the backend software i.e. Operating Systems continues to 
be OEM defined. The RFI process should clearly identify availability of indigenous 
software for running applications on the equipment/system and should be included in 
Buy (Indian – IDDM) and Buy (Indian) cases mandatorily or as Enhanced 
Performance Parameters (EPP). 
 
(g) 
Aero-engines and Fabrication Plants (Fab). 
Aero 
engines 
and 
Fab(facilities manufacturing silicon wafers) manufacture need to be taken up as 
projects of National importance. Aero engines and Fab manufactured in India will 
mandatorily be procured for applicable defence equipment as Buyer’s Nominated 
Equipment (BNE)/ sub-assemblies. These procurements will not be considered as 
Single Vendor Cases (SVC). 
 
Project Management Unit (PMU) 
 
30. 
As part of the Defence Reforms announced in the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, 
setting up of a PMU has been mandated to support contract management so as to usher in 
faster decision making and time bound defence acquisition process. The PMU will facilitate 
obtaining advisory and consultancy support in specified areas to streamline Acquisition 
process. The case for establishment of the PMU and its charter and responsibilities are being 
processed separately and further details will be promulgated accordingly.

Appendix B to Chapter I  
(Refers to Para 21 of Chapter I)  
 
INDIGENOUS CONTENT ASPECTS 
 
Definitions  
 
1.  
For the purposes of the DAP, Indigenous Content (IC) for acquisition case shall be 
arrived at based on the Base Contract Price(i.e. the Total Contract Price less taxes and duties) 
of that equipment/item by excluding the following elements of manufacturing/production/ 
assembly: - 
 
(a) Direct costs (including Custom Duties, Freight/transportation and insurance) of all 
materials, components, sub-assemblies, assemblies and products imported into India.  
 
(b) Direct and Indirect costs of all services obtained from non-Indian entities/citizens.  
 
(c) All license fees, royalties, technical fees and other fees/payments of this nature 
paid out of India, by whatever term/phrase referred to in contracts/agreements made 
by vendors/sub-vendors.  
 
2. 
The format for computation of IC, ‘Indigenous Content (IC) Proforma’ by the Prime 
Vendor is placed as Annexure 1 to this Appendix. The Prime Vendor i.e. the vendor with 
whom the contract is signed, is required to maintain this Proforma for the purpose of any 
Verification by the MoD during the tenure of the contract. 
 
3.  
Further, in all cases where IC is stipulated, it shall imply that IC is required at base 
contract price i.e. total contract price less taxes and duties as specified in the DAP, read in 
conjunction with additional specific requirements in this regard, if any, mentioned in the 
RFP. In cases involving BNE, the cost of the BNE will be excluded from the base contract 
price for the purpose of calculating IC. 
 
Reporting Requirements  
 
4.  
An Indigenisation Plan for Buy (Indian-IDDM), Buy (Indian), Buy & Make (Indian) 
and Buy (Global – Manufacture in India) cases will be required to be submitted by the vendor 
as part of his bid to meet the requirement of IC as specified in Para 8 to 11 of Chapter I of 
DAP. Considering the vast set of vendors in multiple tiers involved in production of Defence 
System/Equipment/item, the requirement for reporting IC are framed such that maximum 
coverage is achieved with practical & reasonable efforts for ensuring compliance. IC should 
be mandatorily reported (as per Annexure 1 and 2) by the Prime Vendor and by all tier 
vendors, who meet either of the under-mentioned conditions, whichever is lower: - 
 
(a)  
Base Contract price of the Tier Vendor exceeds ₹10 crores; or  

15 
 
 
(b)  
Base Contract price of the Tier Vendor is greater than 5% of the base contract 
price of the Prime Vendor. 
  
Note: For this computation, the base contract price of Tier Vendor should include the 
price of all contracts of the Tier Vendor relating to the main contract of the Prime 
Vendor. 
 
5. 
For supplies from the balance tier suppliers and components/equipment bought 
through traders, stockists and/or local agents of foreign suppliers, the foreign  content shall be 
aggregated in the IC Proforma by the Prime Vendor, under the head ‘Others’ at a flat 
estimated rate of 90% of the total value of supplies. In case the Prime Vendor desires, he may 
include import certification for suppliers covered in ‘Others’, over and above the tier 
suppliers considered in paragraph 4 above. 
 
6.  
All Contracts, sub-contracts, agreements and MoUs made by the Prime Vendor with 
their business partners/vendors, in so far as they relate to the main contract of the Prime 
Vendor, shall mandatorily incorporate the definition and reporting requirements for IC as 
above. Similarly, these business partners/vendors shall sequentially incorporate these 
definitions and reporting requirements with their next levels of business partners/vendors and 
so on, covering lower tiers in the manufacturing/production/assembly chain, in respect of 
those tier vendors who meet the conditions mentioned above.  
 
7.  
The Prime Vendor should use the inputs received from all applicable Tier Vendors as 
per Paragraph 4 and 5 above, to compute IC as per Annexure I and II.  
 
Computation of IC 
 
8.  
The Foreign Content (FC) for the Prime Vendors is included in every contract along 
with break-up for each currency. Further, the FC is also monitored while the vendor seeks 
adjustments for Foreign Exchange Rate Variation (FERV) from the Ministry of Defence 
(MoD) as well as at the stage of filing for GST. The final aggregation of FC and thus the 
Computation of IC, shall be undertaken by the Prime Vendor, with whom the contract is 
signed by the MoD/SHQ, as per Annexure -1 to this Appendix. This will be based on 
certifications and inputs received by the Prime Vendor from its’ lower Tier Vendors 
applicable as per paragraph 4 above, as well as on the basis of Prime Vendor’s own 
acquisition actions and manufacturing activities undertaken. 
 
Payments 
 
9. 
In Buy (Global – Manufacture in India) cases, all payments for the Manufactured 
portion will be paid to the vendor in Indian Rupees as per contract provisions. 
 

16 
 
Verification 
 
10.  
The MoD can exercise its right to conduct verification with reasonable notice of 
relevant certifications and costs pertaining to imports for the Contract at all or any stages 
(tiers) of manufacturing/production/assembly, starting from the Prime Vendor downwards. 
The 
Verification 
could 
be 
conducted 
by 
the 
MoD 
itself 
and/or 
by 
an 
agency/institution/officer(s) nominated by the MoD, as may be decided by the MoD during 
the tenure of the Contract and completed within one year of the last delivery under the 
contract. However, financial records will only need to be maintained for duration as 
stipulated by the existing Income Tax regulations at the time of signing of contract. 
Verification of IC will mandatorily be carried out in case where incentivisation/reward for 
higher IC is to be granted and in all Make cases above ₹ 500 crores. 
 
Certification  
 
11.  
All relevant deliveries made under contract shall be accompanied by a certificate of 
IC issued by the ‘Responsible Designated Official’ i.e. the Contract Signing Authority, 
Authorised Signatory etc., of the Prime Vendor and certified by the Statutory Auditor or Cost 
Auditor of the Company (in case of companies) or by a practising Cost Accountant or 
praticising Chartered Accountant (in respect of suppliers other than companies). Further, the 
equipment offered for trial shall be accompanied with a certificate of IC issued similarly, in 
case the RFP mandates IC content during trials. The format for certification of IC by the 
‘Responsible Designated Official’ and Statutory Auditor/Cost Auditor/ certified or licensed 
Cost Accountant/Chartered Accountant shall be as per Annexure II to this Appendix.  
 
12.  
Performance cum Warranty Bank Guarantee (PWBG) shall be released only after the 
submission of a certificate (as per Annexure II) of meeting the overall IC at Contract level 
furnished by the ‘Responsible Designated Official’ of the Prime Vendor, after completion of 
all the contractual deliveries, in addition to any other requirements specified elsewhere in the 
contract.  
 
13.  
Deliveries by the final stage of contract must conform to IC requirements and 
categorisation relevant to that particular stage. The Performance cum Warranty Bank 
Guarantee (PWBG) shall not be released before completing an Verification of the IC in all 
relevant deliveries by the MoD or its nominated agency/institution/officer(s), if such an 
verification is notified and initiated by the MoD.  
 
Withholding of Payments and Imposition of Penalties  
 
14.  
In case the vendor fails to certify achieving mandatory IC for the project, 5% of 
contract value will be withheld till verification of IC as per contract. All such payments 
withheld above shall be forfeited upon failure to achieve required IC post verification. In 
addition, the PWBG shall also be forfeited upon failure to discharge IC obligations as per 

17 
 
contract. In case of incentivisation/ reward for higher IC, the payment of incentivisation/ 
reward will be made only after verification of IC.  
 
15.  
In case mandatory IC is not achieved by a vendor and/or if a false certificate is 
furnished by a vendor/sub-vendor, other than the forfeiture of the Vendor’s IPBG and 
PWBG, the Ministry can impose any other penalty. 
 
Miscellaneous  
 
16.  
In the event of non-incorporation of the definitions and/or verification requirements 
laid down in contracts or agreements by vendors with next tier at any stage (tier) of 
manufacturing/production/assembly, it shall be presumed that items/services provided by that 
stage/tier to the next (tier) have no IC for the purposes of the DAP. Similarly, in the event of 
non-certification of IC at any stage (tier) as required herein, it shall be presumed that 
items/services provided by that stage/tier to the next stage (tier) have no IC for the purposes 
of the DAP. In such cases, the MoD can take any of the steps as per Paragraphs 13 and 14 
above against the Prime Vendor.

CHAPTER II 
 
ACQUISITION PROCEDURES FOR CATEGORIES UNDER ‘BUY’ 
AND ‘BUY AND MAKE’ SCHEMES 
 
Acquisition Process  
 
1. 
The acquisition process for the categories under the ‘Buy’ and ‘Buy & Make’ schemes 
will involve the following processes:- 
 
(a) 
Request for Information (RFI).  
 
(b) 
Formulation of Services Qualitative Requirements (SQRs).  
 
(c) 
Acceptance of Necessity (AoN).  
 
(d) 
Solicitation of offers through Request For Proposal (RFP), including Offset 
offer, if applicable.  
 
(e) 
Evaluation of Technical offers by Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC).  
 
(f) 
Evaluation of Offset offers by Technical Offset Evaluation Committee 
(TOEC). 
 
(g) 
Field Evaluation Trials (FET).

(m) 
Award of Contract/placing of Indents.  
 
(n) 
Post-Contract Management. 
 
Request for Information (RFI)  
 
2. 
Request for Information (RFI), as the name suggests is a means to seek information 
from the vendors; to inter-alia explore suitability of products available to meet the 
Operational Requirements (ORs) of the Services, and to formulate SQRs, maintenance 
philosophy, as well as other contractual provisions. SHQ may explore the feasibility of 

21 
 
subscribing to renowned defence equipment databases/specialist tools/consulting services 
available in the market to assist in examining the types and nature of equipment being 
deployed by our adversaries, as also available in the world as well as domestic market, so as 
to help SHQ in formulation of Integrated Capability Development Plans (ICDP), as well as 
drafting of realistic SQRs, besides assisting CNCs to arrive at realistic benchmarking price. 
 
3. 
The RFI would be hosted on MoD’s Website and SHQ Website, besides being sent to 
known vendor base, for seeking relevant information, on specific acquisition schemes. In 
order to enable wider market survey and participation, SHQ may seek information from 
multiple sources, such as Defence Attaches, internet, other MoD/MHA/law enforcement 
agencies, defence journals/magazines/exhibitions, previously contracted cases and any other 
relevant information source, including renowned defence equipment databases. The issue of 
RFI is not a commitment for procurement.  
 
4. 
Objectives of RFI. 
The main objectives of the RFI are as follows:- 
 
(a) 
To formulate/refine/rationalise SQRs based on a rational combination of 
different product specifications resulting in product requirements that can be 
objectively evaluated.  
 
(b) 
To aid in deciding the acquisition category. 
 
(c) 
To determine the indicative budgetary and cost implications. 
 
(d) 
To seek inputs for formulating Draft Trial Methodology and identify Indian/ 
International Standards applicable for evaluating the SQRs. 
 
(e) 
To generate inputs for structuring of the AoN and RFP.  
 
5. 
Contents of the RFI.  
The RFI should clearly indicate the capabilities sought 
in the equipment/system/platform, quantities required, anticipated delivery timeframes and 
tentative time schedule for the acquisition processes (issue of RFP). A suggested format of 
the RFI is attached at Appendix A to this Chapter. The RFI should inter-alia seek the 
following inputs from the vendors: -  
 
(a) 
Specifications of available product for deriving SQRs from ORs.  
 
(b) 
Scope, depth and range of ToT being offered as well key technologies and 
materials required for manufacturing, identified by SHQ in consultation with other 
stakeholders, as applicable. 
 
(c) 
Ascertain capability of Indian vendors to indigenously design and develop the 
required equipment along with level of indigenisation including use of indigenous 
military material, delivery capability, maintenance support, Life Cycle Support etc. 

22 
 
(d) 
In cases where requisite expertise to indigenously design or manufacture the 
equipment is not available and procurement is envisaged from global vendors; explore 
willingness of global vendors to:- 
 
(i) 
Enhance indigenisation and setup dedicated manufacturing line, 
including design, integration and manufacturing processes in India, either 
through its own subsidiary or in a joint venture with an Indian company. 
Willingness and ability to transfer desired technologies to Indian industry or to 
a Joint Venture (JV), in case Transfer of Technology (ToT) is envisaged. 
 
(ii) 
Progressively undertake indigenous manufacture of systems, sub-
systems, components, consumables, spares, ammunition, materials, etc, of the 
main equipment/platform in India, either through its own subsidiary or in a 
Joint Venture with an Indian company or transfer know how to an Indian 
Company. 
 
(iii) 
To transfer technology for maintenance infrastructure, where 
applicable. Set-up an ecosystem of indigenous vendors/manufacturers for 
sustenance of the equipment in terms of repairs of systems, sub-systems, 
assemblies, components, etc. as also testing facilities. 
 
(iv) 
Consider making India, a regional/global hub for manufacturing/ 
Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul (MRO) of the equipment. 
 
(v) 
To procure indigenous raw materials or facilitate ToT for production of 
raw materials. 
 
(e) 
Approximate cost estimation and suggestions for alternatives to meet the same 
objective as mentioned in RFI.  
 
(f) 
Inputs for evolving Maintenance Philosophy, including aspects such as 
Engineering Support Package (ESP), Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC), Life-
Cycle Support, Performance Based Logistics and other maintenance arrangements, 
training requirements etc.  
 
(g) 
Inputs on compliance to test standards followed in India, certifications 
available with vendor pertaining to quality management and quality of 
product/systems and their accreditation bodies, test facilities available for certification 
in firm premises or in the country of OEM. 
 
6. 
Formulation of RFI.  
RFI would be formulated by SHQ, in consultation with 
DRDO, DDP and HQ IDS. A copy of the draft RFI will be shared with DRDO, DDP, HQ IDS 
and other Services (for comments on issues of commonality and interoperability), to ensure 
that comprehensive response is generated from vendors to facilitate addressing all aspects of 

23 
 
operational requirements and defining attributes. All agencies should provide their comments 
within six weeks of receiving the draft RFI, post which ‘Nil’ comments will be assumed. The 
comments obtained would be incorporated, where applicable. RFI will also ask for details 
about the vendors as per the ‘Information Proforma’ attached at Annexure II to Appendix A, 
Questionnaire attached at Annexure III to Appendix A and ‘Guidelines for Framing Criteria 
for Vendor Selection’ attached at Annexure IV to Appendix A, which will be appended to the 
RFI. SHQ should clearly bring it to the notice of the respondents that non conformity/ no 
response to any query in the RFI would in no way debar them from issue of RFP. RFI is also 
meant to provide advance intimation to the vendors to obtain requisite government 
clearances. 
 
7. 
Interaction with Vendors. 
Extensive interactions should be held by the SHQ with 
the vendors/industry after uploading the broad details of the scheme on MoD and SHQ 
websites. After interaction, vendors should be given sufficient time (not less than eight 
weeks) to respond to the RFI. Extension of time for submission of RFI responses may be 
given by SHQ. Prior to finalisation of SQRs, SHQ may also interact again with the industry, 
if required. The inputs so obtained should result in the form of a compliance table of SQRs, 
vis-á-vis technical parameters of equipment available. 
 
8. 
Competency Map. 
Based on the RFI responses from the vendors, a ‘Competency 
Map’ of the indigenous manufacturing industry and raw material producers should be 
prepared/updated by Department of Defence Production (DDP) and shared with the SHQ on 
a bi-annual basis.  
 
Military Materials 
 
9. 
Indigenous availability of high-end materials and special alloys is an important pre-
requisite for self-reliance. The methodology of classification of military material and process 
of classification/ identification/ development to aid in formulation of suitable approach for 
promotion of use of indigenous materials and in encouraging their development will be 
promulgated separately. 
 
10. 
Dissemination of Information on Materials. 
MoD may obtain information of 
material requirement and their availability, from all relevant stakeholders like various 
platform manufacturers, material manufacturers/ developers, DPSUs/ Industry Associations/ 
DRDO/ Services/ HQIDS and provide a suitable platform for periodic interaction between all 
stakeholders including material manufacturers. 
 
11. 
Promotion of Use of Military Materials. 
To ascertain the feasibility of use of 
indigenous military materials already being manufactured in the country, SHQ during the RFI 
stage may examine acquisition projects for platforms and other equipment/ systems other 
than ‘Buy Global’ projects, with substantial material component. If the material is known to 
be available, an RFI to material manufacturers may be issued and further information may be  
 

24 
 
sought on the following aspects: - 
 
(a) 
Identification of the main material in case of platforms and details of major 
input materials in case of equipment/ systems. 
 
 (b) 
Availability in the country and known sources with material designation, 
standard/code and grade, and test standards. 
 
(c) 
Equivalence of standard/code at paragraph 3 (b) above with those required. 
 
(d) 
Vendor’s likely plan for sourcing the material(s). 
 
(e) 
Likely cost of material(s) if sourced from Indian vendors as compared to their 
import cost. 
 
12. 
Based on the outcomes of the above exercise/internal Feasibility Study and 
approximate cost of material as arrived from RFI response from Main Vendor or Material 
Manufacturer, if the feasibility of inclusion of use of indigenous material(s) within the project 
timelines is ascertained, SHQ, at the time of seeking AoN, may include the proposed 
methodology for sourcing the material for the project in the SoC (in ‘The Scope for Use of 
Indigenous Materials’ section of SoC) as per following:- 
 
Ser 
No 
Reason for Not Using 
Indigenous Raw Material 
Suggested Methodology 
(a) 
Material(s) available in India 
but not being utilised for 
military applications due to 
lack 
of 
knowledge 
of 
availability of material(s) in 
India and/ or for convenience 
of use of material(s) from 
established import source 
Define the requirement of use of only 
indigenous material(s) and/ or; 
Provide reward upto 5% of the cost of the 
material subject to a cap of 0.5% of total 
order value. In case of more than one 
material being used, the reward for each 
material should be in proportion to relative 
value and/ or; 
Indicate likely sources as BNE material.  
(b) 
Not being utilised for military 
applications due to cost of 
indigenous material(s) being 
marginally higher compared 
to import cost 
Define the requirement of using only 
indigenous material(s) and/ or; 
Provide reward up to 10% of the cost of the 
material subject to maximum ceiling of 
0.75% of total order value. In case of more 
than one material being used, the reward for 
each material should be in proportion to 
relative value. 
(c) 
Not being utilised as the 
indigenous material(s) 
not 
Provide reward up to 15% of the cost of the 
material subject to max ceiling of 1.0% of

Reason for Not Using 
Indigenous Raw Material 
Suggested Methodology 
validated 
total order value. In case of more than one 
material being used, the reward for each 
material should be in proportion to relative 
value. Based on number of materials 
identified 
and 
value 
addition 
to 
the 
manufacturing eco-system, additional reward 
may be granted by DAC on case to case 
basis. However, in all cases the cap for 
reward would remain at 1% of total project 
cost. 
 
Note. 
 
(i) 
Validation of the materials would be undertaken in accordance with Quality 
Assurance Plan (QAP) and would be the responsibility of the vendor, to be eligible for the 
reward towards use of indigenous Military Materials. MoD may consider constitution of a 
suitable committee to monitor/qualify the materials, where required, on a case to case basis. 
For the purpose of calculating the reward, the estimated value of material as obtained from 
RFI data is to be indicated in the RFP. 
 
(ii) 
In cases where the utilisation of indigenous materials has distinct advantages, to 
justify by extending the ‘Upper Cap’, specific approval of the DAC may be sought. 
 
Indigenous Software 
 
13. 
In order to leverage the highly developed indigenous software expertise existing in 
the country, it is pertinent that maximum equipment should function with indigenous 
software (certification by the Statutory Auditor of the Bidder that the software has been 
developed within India) driving the desired applications while the backend software i.e. 
Operating Systems continues to be OEM defined. The RFI process should clearly identify 
availability of indigenous software for running applications on the equipment/system and its 
analysis should determine whether the project should mandatorily require the vendors to base 
applications being run on their solution (especially critical components like Fire Control 
System, Radars, Communications, Encryption sub systems) on indigenous software in Buy 
(Indian – IDDM) and Buy (Indian) cases. In case the requirement is not made mandatory, 
Enhanced Performance Parameters (EPP) with respect to indigenous software should be 
defined with commensurate credit score (as per Paragraph 14 (c) of Chapter II) in the SQRs 
to provide for the enhanced capability being offered. 
 
Services Qualitative Requirements (SQRs) 
 
14. 
Characteristics of SQR. 
All capital acquisitions will be based on SQRs, which 

26 
 
need to lay down the fundamental user requirements in a comprehensive manner. The SQRs 
need to be realistic, achievable and verifiable and must avoid ambiguity of any type. SQRs 
must not be tailored from/for a particular product or service and must result in procurement 
of the items that best meet the requirements of the Services. The SQRs would be based 
primarily on operational, technical, maintainability, ergonomic and enhanced performance 
parameters. It may not be viable for all vendors to produce a complex and costly equipment 
precisely customised for unique requirements, within limited time and in limited numbers, 
for assessment and evaluation at Field Evaluation Trial (FET) stage. The parameters of 
SQRs, which are generated through RFI process, are classified as under and further detailed 
as part of the RFP:- 
 
(a) 
Essential Parameters-A. 
These are parameters that are generally a part of 
the contemporary equipment available in the market and form the core of the SQRs; 
Essential Parameters -A will be tested and validated at FET stage.  
 
(b) 
Essential Parameters-B. 
Though not available originally in the equipment 
fielded for the FET, these parameters can be developed and achieved by the vendors 
using available technologies. These parameters need to be tested and validated within 
a specified time frame as stipulated in the contract. These tests for Essential 
Parameters - B should also validate that there is no adverse effect on any of the 
Essential Parameters - A. However, vendors should be able to substantiate and need to 
provide an undertaking, at the bid submission stage, that they will develop and meet 
the Essential Parameters - B with their existing capabilities, on entering into a 
contract. In procurement cases involving Essential Parameters - B, an Additional 
Bank Guarantee (ABG) valued between 5% and 10% of the contract value of 
equipment required with Essential Parameters - B, as determined by the AoN 
according authority, needs to be submitted, in addition to the Performance Bank 
Guarantee; the quantum of the Additional Bank Guarantee must be stated in the RFP. 
Failure to meet the Essential Parameters - B after signing of the contract and within 
the stipulated time frame, will lead to forfeiture of all bank guarantees (Performance 
cum Warranty Bank Guarantee, Additional Bank Guarantee and Advance Payments 
Bank Guarantees if any) and attract other penal provisions as may be prescribed by 
the Government. On meeting the Essential Parameters - B as per contract terms, the 
Additional Bank Guarantee will be released and returned to the contracted vendor. 
Essential Parameters - B may be evaluated at the FET stage, if any equipment, as 
claimed by the vendor(s), can meet them and are willing to get their equipment trial 
evaluated for Essential Parameters B at FET stage (a written undertaking in this 
regard will be obtained from the vendor prior to commencement of FET by SHQ). 
However, failure to comply with Essential Parameters - B at the FET stage will not be 
criteria for rejection and the Vendor will be evaluated for the same post contract. 
Essential Parameters - A and Essential Parameters - B (if applicable) are non-
negotiable requirements to be met by the vendor, prior to commencement of 
equipment delivery. The provision to incorporate Essential Parameters - B will be 
used only when required, with approval of AoN according authority and will not be 

27 
 
used when two or more vendors claim to possess the same at the RFI stage. Essential 
Parameters - B will not be included in ab-initio single vendor cases. Essential 
Parameters - B may also be incorporated in the SoC, for provision of partial quantities 
of the items being procured, to meet different/higher specifications for specific 
operational requirements. 
 
(c) 
Enhanced Performance Parameters (EPP).       EPP are those parameters 
that enhance the capability of the equipment, vis-à-vis the operational, technical, 
maintainability/ergonomic parameters; a SQR may not contain EPP in all cases. 
Inability to meet the EPP does not preclude vendors from being eligible for the 
bidding/bid evaluation. However, if a vendor claims to have equipment meeting the 
EPP as specified in SQR and RFP, then they must provide details of the same in their 
technical bids, which have to be tested for compliance during the FET itself. 
Equipment successfully meeting the EPP parameters will be awarded a credit score of 
up to 10%, for evaluation of L1, with each individual attribute not exceeding a credit 
score of up to 3%, as approved by the AoN according authority. In case procurement 
involves EPP, then the EPP and their credit scores need to be explicitly detailed in the 
RFP. In such cases, if the equipment supplied by a vendor does not have the EPP, then 
the commercial quote of the vendor, for the purpose of L1 determination, remains as 
it is. In cases where a vendor’s equipment meets the EPP, the commercial quote will 
be multiplied by a credit factor less than 1 and greater than or equal to 0.9, based on 
the additional technical score assigned for the EPP, as detailed in the RFP. For 
example, if a vendor quotes ₹ 10 crores for an equipment and meets a certain EPP for 
which an additional credit score of 2% is being provided, then the commercial quote 
of this vendor will be considered for L1 determination purpose only, as ₹ 9.8 crores 
(10 crores multiplied by 0.98) and not ₹10 crores; however, for all purposes other 
than L1 determination, the value of the commercial quote will be considered as ₹ 10 
crores only.  
 
15. 
SQR Formulation. 
The SQRs would be drafted by the concerned User directorate 
at SHQ. In addition to obtaining the required inputs from RFI analysis, SHQ will seek 
information from Defence Attaches, internet, defence journals/magazines/exhibitions, 
previously contracted cases in such category and any other relevant and credible information 
source. Due cognisance will be paid to the capabilities of appreciated adversaries while 
formulating the SQRs. A ‘Comparative Analysis of Specifications’ of similar products 
available in the World and domestic market will be carried out and draft SQRs will be 
prepared. Draft SQRs would be circulated by SHQ to all external stakeholders to include HQ 
IDS, DRDO, DDP, Quality Assurance (QA) agencies, Directorate of Standardisation, 
Technical Managers and any other necessary department for obtaining their views/comments. 
 
16. 
Format of SQRs.  
The SQRs, as far as possible, would follow a standardised 
format as under :- 
 
 
(a) 
Introduction 
& 
Operational 
Philosophy/Proposed 
Employment 
of 

28 
 
equipment/system/platform. 
 
 
 
(b) 
Essential Parameters-A. 
 
 
 
(i) 
Operational Parameters. 
Unambiguous, non-negotiable, essential 
functional requirements laid down by the Services, which clearly define basic 
profile of an equipment/system, specifying minimum acceptable performance 
requirements thereby defining ‘Core Capabilities’ of the equipment/system 
would be termed as Operational Parameters. 
 
 
 
 
 
(ii) 
Technical Parameters. 
Based on the Operational Parameters, 
scientific and technical characteristics required in the system to achieve these 
operational capabilities would be drawn out after due analysis of 
contemporary and developing technology in the field. 
 
 
 
(iii) 
Maintainability & Ergonomic Parameters. 
These parameters 
will primarily relate to aspects like maintenance, crew comfort, storage of 
equipment, packing material etc. 
 
 
 
(c) 
Essential Parameters-B. 
 
 
(d) 
Enhanced Performance Parameters (EPP) along with proposed credit scores. 
 
17. 
Formulation of Joint Service Quality Requirements (JSQRs). In 
cases where 
other Services also intend to procure similar equipment in the next three years, the lead 
Service will process the JSQRs through the Integrated Staff Equipment Policy Committee 
(ISEPC). Conversion of SQR to JSQRs will not be mandatory in cases where the other 
Service(s) accept the SQRs. Also, in cases where quantities required by other Service(s) is 
20% or less as compared to the lead service, joint procurement case would be progressed on 
the lead Service SQRs itself. In cases, where a Service opts to join an ongoing procurement 
case of other service at the time of seeking AoN, with no change in the SQRs, the case would 
be progressed on the lead service SQRs, and the same SQRs would be subsequently 
converted into JSQRs, for future procurements. 
 
18. 
Approval of SQRs/JSQRs. SQRs (except Shipbuilding cases) will be fielded for 
approval of the respective Staff Equipment Policy Committees (SEPC) within six months of 
the receipt of RFI responses. SHQ should satisfy that the stipulations mentioned in the DAP 
have been followed while recommending the SQRs for the approval of the respective Staff 
Equipment Committees. SEPCs will be authorised to consult Subject Matter Experts as 
deemed necessary while finalising SQRs. In cases of JSQRs, the same would be approved by 
the ISEPC. A copy of the approved SQR/JSQR along with the ‘Comparative Analysis of 
Specifications’ of similar products available in the World and domestic market as per 
Paragraph 15 above would be submitted along with the ‘Statement of Case’ (SoC) for 
seeking AoN.  

29 
 
19. 
Amendment to SQR Parameters. There may be situations wherein SQRs need to 
be amended post accord of AoN, till issue of RFP. In case the requirement is to amend 
Operational and Technical parameters of SQR, the approval for same would be accorded by 
AoN according authority. However, for amendment of Maintainability and Ergonomic 
parameters of SQR, the approval may be accorded by Staff Equipment Policy Committee 
(SEPC)/ Integrated Staff Equipment Policy Committee (ISEPC). No amendment to SQRs 
will be carried out after issue of RFP without approval of DAC. 
 
20. 
Quality standards such as JSS/other relevant standards will be mentioned in the SQRs. 
Based on the operating conditions stipulated in the SQRs by the User, selection and sequence 
of tests for checking compliance to the standards shall be formulated by QA agencies. SQRs 
should contain specific and verifiable parameters for the capabilities sought. Generic terms 
such as ‘all weather capability’, ‘state-of-the-art’, etc, are not to be included. 
 
Acceptance of Necessity (AoN)  
 
21. 
AoN based on SQRs/JSQRs will be obtained by SHQ within one year of their 
approval by the respective SEPC /ISEPC. Extension for obtaining AoN till upto six months 
after 
the 
stipulated 
one 
year 
may 
be 
granted 
by 
respective 
CISC/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DGICG and a further extension of six months by DG 
(Acquisition). In order to seek AoN, the SHQ will carry out detailed internal consultations 
and prepare a draft Statement of Case (SoC) as per format at Appendix B, assisted by 
guidelines at Appendix C. The draft SoC would be approved by the Head of the respective 
User/Plans Directorate/equivalent of the Services.  
 
22. 
Processing of AoN : Non Delegated Power Cases.  Copies of the draft SoC would 
be forwarded to DDP, DRDO, Acquisition Wing (with additional copies for the concerned JS 
& AMs, ADG Acquisition Technical and FM) and HQ IDS. Quantity vetting would be carried 
out by FMs as per SOP promulgated by MoD (Finance). HQ IDS would examine aspects of 
interoperability and commonality of equipment for the three Services. All addressees will 
forward their comments within four weeks of receipt. The finalised SoC, duly considering all 
comments received, will be fielded in the Defence Procurement Board (DPB) by the 
concerned SHQ. A copy of the approved SQRs/JSQRs along with the ‘Comparative Analysis 
of Specifications’ of similar products available in the World and domestic market as per 
Paragraph 15 above would be submitted along with the SoC for seeking AoN. Secretariat of 
DPB will circulate the SoC to all Members and invitees as applicable. AoN for all cases more 
than ₹ 300 crores and upto ₹ 500 crores will be accorded by the DPB. In cases beyond ₹ 500 
crores, DPB will recommend categorisation, based on the proposal of the SHQ and refer 
these to the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) for accord of AoN. The SoC, duly amended 
as per recommendations of the DPB, will be forwarded to the DAC Secretariat for fielding in 
DAC. Secretariat of DAC will circulate the SoC being fielded in DAC to all Members and 
invitees. A draft RFP will also be forwarded by SHQ to respective ADGs Acquisition 
Technical along with a copy of the SoC being fielded in DPB/DAC for accord of AoN. The 

30 
 
DPB and DAC will be held at least once every two months and minutes of the same should 
be issued within two weeks of the meeting. 
 
23. 
Processing of AoN: Delegated Power Cases.  Copies of the draft SoC for cases with 
AoN cost ≤ ₹ 300 crores would be forwarded to DDP, DRDO, PIFA/IFA (Capital), HQ IDS 
and the respective ADG Acquisition Technical. Quantity vetting would be carried out by 
PIFA/IFA (Capital) as per SOP promulgated by MoD (Finance). HQ IDS would examine 
aspects of interoperability and commonality of equipment for the three services. All 
addressees will forward their comments within four weeks of receipt.  The finalised SoC, 
duly considering all comments received, will be fielded in the Services Procurement Board 
(SPB), erstwhile SCAPCHC (Delegated), by the concerned SHQ for accord of AoN. A copy 
of the approved SQRs/JSQRs along with the ‘Comparative Analysis of Specifications’ of 
similar products available in the World and domestic market as per Paragraph 15 above 
would be submitted along with the SoC for seeking AoN. Secretariat of SPB will circulate the 
SoC to all members and invitees as applicable. SPB will be held at least once every month 
and minutes of the same should be issued within two weeks of the meeting. Post accord of 
AoN, SHQ will hold an internal collegiate for RFP vetting and forward the draft RFP to 
respective ADGs Acquisition Technical. Cases with AoN cost ≤ ₹ 100 crores will be reserved 
for MSMEs, provided there are at least two or more MSMEs eligible to participate in the 
category. 
 
24. 
Categorisation of Schemes. Preference will be given to indigenous design, 
development and manufacturing of defence equipment. The time required for the 
procurement and delivery from foreign sources vis-à-vis the time required for making it 
within India, along with the urgency and criticality of the requirement will be examined 
before deciding to proceed on categorisation. Therefore, wherever Indian Industry is capable 
of manufacturing the required equipment within the timelines required by the Services, the 
procurement will be made from indigenous sources. The MoD has notified a list of 
weapons/platforms banned for import, updated from time to time and SHQ will ensure that 
no weapon/platform figuring on the list is procured ex import. These equipment may, 
therefore, be procured under the Buy (Indian - IDDM), Buy (Indian), Buy and Make (Indian) 
(only if Buy quantities are zero) and Buy and Make (only if Buy quantities are zero) 
categories of procurement. In accordance with the priority of categorisation given at 
Paragraph 5 of Chapter I and based on 'Defining Attributes and Decision Flowchart' attached 
at Appendix D to this Chapter, SoC seeking AoN shall contain detailed justification for 
recommending categorisation as well as reasons why each of the higher priority categories 
have not been considered suitable for the purpose. AoN according authority will consider the 
same while carrying out categorisation. The AoN according authority may accord AoN with 
higher or lower threshold of IC than those stipulated for various categories on a case to case 
basis. Detailed justification for the change approved/recommended will be included in the 
minutes of the SPB/DPB/DAC.  
 

31 
 
25. 
Option Clause. 
In cases where Option Clause is being exercised, SHQ will 
examine the viability of the same vis-á-vis fresh procurement and the same will be endorsed 
in the SoC for seeking AoN.  
 
26. 
Splitting Source of Supply.  
In cases, where it is decided in advance to have 
more than one source of supply, specific approval will be taken in AoN for ratio of splitting 
the supply between (first lowest bidder) L1 and (second lowest bidder) L2 vendors, provided 
L2 vendor accepts the price and terms and conditions quoted by/negotiated with the L1 
vendor, and the same will be pre-disclosed in the RFP. 
 
27. 
Interaction with Industry.  
Cases where participation by Indian industry is 
envisaged, the SPB/DPB may invite representatives nominated by industry associations to 
provide inputs related to the scheme. The representatives would, however, not be present in 
the internal discussions and during the decision making process of the SPB/DPB. The inputs 
received from Industry and recommendations of the SPB/DPB (as applicable) would be 
included in the minutes and highlighted before the AoN according authority.  
 
28. 
AoN for Fast Track Procedure (FTP). 
Cases where expeditious procurement for 
urgent operational requirements foreseen as imminent or for situations in which a crisis 
emerges without a prior warning, or where undue/unforeseen delay due to reasons beyond the 
control of the acquisition set up, are seen to be adversely impacting the capacity and 
preparedness of the Forces, may be recommended by SHQ for pursuance of FTP. Considering 
the merits of the case and the timelines required, DAC may approve any procurement to be 
pursued under FTP while according AoN. Post grant of AoN, FTP cases would be processed 
as per non-delegated/delegated power cases as per provisions of Chapter V of DAP 2020. 
 
29. 
Offsets. 
The Offsets Clause would be applicable for Buy (Global) categories of 
procurement where the estimated AoN cost of the Buy portion is ₹ 2000 crores or more. An 
Indian Vendor participating in the Buy (Global) category would be required to meet 
minimum 30% IC, failing which such vendor would be required to discharge offsets as 
applicable in the case. In certain cases, the DAC may consider partial or full waiver of the 
Offsets clause. In case of a waiver for a particular acquisition case, eligible/selected Indian 
vendors also need to be exempted from the corresponding IC stipulations. No offsets will be 
applicable in all ab-initio Single Vendor cases, including procurements based on IGA/FMS. 
The procedure for implementing the Offsets provisions is attached at Appendix E. 
 
30. 
AoN Validity.  
AoN for categories under ‘Buy’ schemes will be valid for six 
months, while AoN will be valid for one year in case of ‘Buy and Make (Indian)’ category 
and all Turnkey projects. The validity of AoN would commence from the date of formal issue 
of Minutes of Meeting of the AoN according authority. AoN would lapse for all cases where 
the RFP is not issued within the original validity period of AoN. In such cases, the SHQ 
would need to either seek re-validation of AoN or obtain a fresh AoN with due justification 
for not processing the case in time. For cases where the original RFP has been issued within 
the original validity period of AoN and later retracted for any reason, the AoN would 

32 
 
continue to remain valid, as long as the original decision and categorisation remain 
unchanged, provided the subsequent RFP is issued within a time period not exceeding the 
original validity period of the AoN, from the date of retraction of original RFP.  
 
31. 
Ab-initio Single Vendor Cases. 
Progressing of ab-initio Single Vendor cases 
may be carried out by the SHQ in the following cases:- 
 
(a) 
If certain equipment being manufactured by only one vendor, which may not 
necessarily be a DPSU, is to be procured to attain qualitative edge over our adversary, 
then such cases should be discussed, deliberated and decided by the AoN according 
authority, after proper technology scan is carried out by SHQ, in consultation with 
DRDO/other stakeholders, as applicable. 
 
(b) 
Cases which are being undertaken by DRDO/DPSUs/OFB/Indian private 
industry as Design and Development projects or ToT has been obtained earlier by an 
Indian vendor, would not fall in the category of Single Vendor cases. However, 
approval of the AoN according authority for carrying out these projects needs to be 
sought prior to commencement of the Design and Development process. 
 
(c) 
If DPSUs/OFB/Indian private industry signs a MoU with a foreign firm for co-
production/ToT/procurement of equipment to be offered to Services with approval of 
DAC, then such procurements, at a later point of time, would not be considered Single 
Vendor Cases. Alternatively, if the DPSUs/OFB/Indian private industry signs a MoU 
without the approval of the DAC, then it would have to compete in a competitive 
manner for the said procurement.  
 
Turnkey Projects 
 
32. 
These are cases where the project involves supply, installation and commissioning of 
varied 
machines/equipment 
for 
establishing 
specialised 
maintenance/ 
information 
technology/communication/storage/overhauling facilities (with or without infrastructure) at 
one or more locations in the country. Such projects including up-gradation/ modernisation of 
existing assets may be carried out on Turnkey Basis and may also include setting up of 
requisite specialised technical infrastructure. The scope of such projects is large and varied 
involving number of activities; hence there is a requirement of identifying a single agency 
capable of completing the project on a Turnkey basis. SOP for undertaking Turnkey Projects 
has been promulgated vide MoD ID No. 3(65)/D(Acq)/14 dated 17 April 2014 and the same 
would be followed as amended from time to time.  
 
Leasing 
 
33. 
Leasing will be another Category for acquisition in addition to the existing ‘Buy’ and 
‘Make’ acquisition categories and would be permitted in two sub categories i.e. Lease  
 

33 
 
(Indian) and Lease (Global). The lease process will have the following stages:- 
 
(a)  
Request for Information (RFI). 
 
(b)  
Identification of Equipment and Operational Demonstration to identify the 
equipment that best meets the capability sought. 
 
(c)  
Preparation of Leasing Operational Requirements (LOR). 
 
(d)  
AoN for lease cases upto ₹ 500 Cr will be accorded by the DPB (after being 
recommended by the SPB) and cases above ₹ 500 Cr by the DAC (after being 
recommended by the DPB). 
 
(e)  
Solicitation of offers. 
 
(f)  
TEC. 
 
(g)  
CNC. 
 
(h)  
Approval by CFA. 
 
(i)  
Signing of Lease Agreement. 
 
(j)  
Post Lease management. 
 
34. 
Various aspects of a lease case, including types of lease, details to be included in the 
abridged SoC, sample lease agreements, etc, will be as per Chapter IX of the DAP. 
 
Hosting of AoN Details 
 
35. 
Subsequent to the accord of AoN, the broad details of the projects/procurement would 
be hosted on the MoD and SHQ websites within one week of issue of minutes, less AoN for 
classified cases that shall not be uploaded on the MoD and SHQ websites, keeping security 
aspects in mind. Additional vendors, who did not respond to the RFI, may express interest for 
receipt of RFP and submission of bid, within four weeks from the date of publication of 
details on these websites. 
 
Special Provisions for Buy and Make (Indian) Category

Request for Proposal (RFP) 
 
41. 
Solicitation of Offers. 
Solicitation of offers will be as per ‘Single Stage - Two 
Bid System’. It will imply that a RFP would be issued soliciting the technical and commercial 
bids together, but in two separate and sealed envelopes. In cases where no TEC and FET are 
envisaged, approval to issue Commercial RFP/placing of Indent would be solicited as part of 
the AoN. 
 
42. 
Layout of RFP. 
The RFP will be a self-contained document that shall clearly 
bring out the requirements of the deliverables and the timelines of delivery to enable vendors 
to make their offer after consideration of full requirements of the acquisition. A standardised 
RFP format is attached as Schedule Ito this Chapter for guidelines. Various flowcharts driven 
guidelines are placed at Appendix C to aid in framing the RFP. RFP may be varied based on 
these guidelines, depending on the user requirements, type/complexity of equipment/ 
machinery/test equipment and operational imperatives, scope of Engineering Support 

35 
 
Package (ESP), expected timelines for commissioning etc. RFP will generally consist of five 
parts as under:- 
 
(a) 
Covering Letter. 
The covering letter provides a brief synopsis of the 
project giving the broad description of equipment and systems, various timelines of 
bidding process and special features of the RFP. 
 
(b) 
General Requirements. 
The first part elaborates the general requirement 
of the equipment, the numbers required, the time frame for deliveries, Non-
Disclosure, Business Eligibility, Indigenous Content, Preservation, Training and ToTs 
for Maintenance Infrastructure, Offset obligations (if applicable) and warranty/ 
guarantee conditions etc. It specifies the prescribed procedure and last date and time 
for submission of offers.  
 
(c) 
Technical Requirements. 
The second part of the RFP incorporates the 
SQRs describing the technical parameters of the proposed equipment in clear and 
unambiguous terms. In case equipment is being procured for the first time and needs 
to be evaluated, the RFP will include the requirement of field evaluation on a ‘No 
Cost No Commitment’ (NCNC) basis except in cases under Paragraph 67 of this 
Chapter. The details of environmental parameters for functioning, conditions of usage 
and maintenance, requirement for training, Engineering Support Package (ESP), Life 
Cycle Support, aspects related to Performance Based Logistics or/and Annual 
Maintenance Contract (AMC), Quality Assurance, Packaging and Marking, Detailed 
Project Report (DPR) and Project Monitoring will also be included here. Compliance

(d) 
Commercial Requirements. The third part of the RFP outlines the 
commercial aspects of the procurement, including clear statements on Payment 
Terms, Performance-cum-Warranty Guarantees, and Additional Bank Guarantee in 
respect of Essential Parameters-B (if applicable) and Guarantees against Warranty 
Services to be performed by the supplier. It also includes standard contract terms 
along with special contractual conditions, if any. DPSUs/OFB will also furnish all 
Bank Guarantees, as applicable, while participating in multi vendor cases along with 
private vendors. DPSUs/OFB will, however, be exempted from submitting all Bank 
Guarantees when nominated as Ab-initio Single Vendor in the AoN. In cases where 
only Indian Vendors participate, a Price Variation Clause (PVC) may also be 
incorporated in the RFP for all cases where the period of deliverables commencing 
post contract is more than 36 months in accordance with General Financial Rules 
(GFR) guidelines. PVC will be applicable from 18 months after last date of bid 
submission till bid opening date, provided the delay is not on account of the bidder 
and thereafter from contract effective date onwards, on the cost of the basic 
equipment and separately on AMC/CMC/PBL/LCSC as relevant. Formula and 
application of the PVC will be as per guidelines given at Paragraph 10 of Schedule I 
of Chapter II. PVC formula will apply only to the Indian Rupees component of the 

36 
 
price. Exchange Rate Variation will be applicable to the Foreign currency component 
of the price, if stated as part of the RFP. PVC may also be applied in all ab-intio SVC 
with foreign vendors progressed through agreements like IGA or otherwise. Indices to 
be applied for such cases will be decided by the Collegiate for RFP vetting. 
 
(e) 
Bid Evaluation and Acceptance Criteria. The fourth part of the RFP 
defines the criteria for evaluation, trial methodology and acceptance, both in terms of 
technical and commercial contents. A format will be enclosed for submission along 
with commercial offer to facilitate preparation of Comparative Statement of Tenders 
(CST) duly incorporating credit score for EPP wherever applicable and identification 
of Lowest (L1) vendor. Submission of incomplete details in the format enclosed, 
along with commercial offer, will render the offer liable for rejection.  
 
43. 
Retention of Trial Equipment. 
For trials conducted in the country, trial 
equipment of compliant vendors may be retained till the approval of Staff Evaluation report. 
In case, SHQ desires to retain trial equipment beyond the Staff Evaluation stage, the same 
will be stated upfront in the RFP. 
 
44. 
Trial Methodology. The Trial Methodology will be part of the RFP and should be, 
to the extent feasible, comprehensive and un-ambiguous in its scope. SHQ will ensure that 
trial methodology is realistic and commensurate to employability and applicability based QR 
validation. The Trial Methodology should provide the vendors a clear and objective 
assessment of the extent of trial evaluation, including parameters where vendor certification, 
certification from accredited labs and trials by simulation are accepted. As far as feasible, 
SHQ, along with trial agencies may interact with OEM(s)/vendors prior to finalising the Trial 
Methodology. 
 
45. 
Contents of Trial Methodology. 
This following should be included in the Trial 
Methodology:- 
 
 
(a) 
Trial Matrix.  
Trial methodology shall inter-alia include a ‘Trial 
Matrix’ giving details of qualifying parameters that will be part of trial evaluation, i.e. 
physical characteristics, operational and technical and environmental parameters, 
MET and EMI / EMC tests, as applicable. 
 
(b) 
Certificate of Conformance (CoC).  
Attributes/parameters for which 
Certificate of Conformance (CoC) along with test standards and test results from 
NABL/ internationally accredited and government designated labs are acceptable, 
should be clearly mentioned, so as to enable prospective vendors to obtain necessary 
certifications for submission as part of RFP response or as part of FET, as applicable. 
In such cases, RFP shall indicate the CoC format (where applicable) which is required 
to be submitted along with technical bids for validating CoC. 
 

37 
 
(c) 
Cases where either FET in total, or parts thereof are not envisaged, the same 
should be stated upfront in the Trial Methodology. 
 
46. 
Quality Assurance (QA) Aspects.   QA agencies will formulate specific QA 
Instructions and technical evaluation plan, as per relevant tests mentioned in standards like 
JSS 55555 and the same will form part of the RFP. The following issues will be clearly stated 
as part of the QAP:- 
 
(a) 
QA Parameters where vendor certification, certification from accredited labs 
and trials by simulation are accepted will be given out in the QA Instructions. 
 
(b) 
For technical trials by QA agencies, the vendor will arrange for requisite test 
facilities at OEM premises/accredited laboratories/facilities for conduct of static and 
dynamic testing of armament stores for establishing conformance. The successful 
bidder would also be required to provide those test facilities at OEM 
premises/accredited laboratories for quality assurance, which are not available with 
QA agencies. Details of the same will be intimated to the bidder during finalisation of 
ATP in Technical Trials.  
 
(c) 
Details Related to Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP).   The QA Instructions, 
as part of the RFP, will clearly specify indicative reference for number of samples for 
destructive tests planned to be carried out during Acceptance Tests, which will be 
provided at the Seller’s cost, over and above the quantities to be delivered. These 
would include missiles/ammunition to check proof firing, assemblies/sub-assemblies 
for destructive test etc, required to assure quality and reliability of the equipment. In 
case, additional quantities than those mentioned in the RFP, are required by QA 
agencies during ATP, the same will be provided for by the vendor at the Buyer’s cost. 
The RFP will accordingly inform vendors to submit draft ATP, as applicable, along 
with their Technical Bid or at least one month before commencement of FET. Based 
on the draft ATP, ATP will be finalised by the QA agency with vendor along with 
SHQ/User representative during Technical Trials (QA and Environmental Testing). In 
cases where no FET is to be conducted, ATP will be finalised at the CNC stage. ATP 
shall be included in the contract at the time of finalisation with successful bidder and 
will lay down the tests to be carried out during Pre Dispatch Inspection (PDI) and 
Joint Receipt Inspection (JRI). It will be ensured that there are no repetitions of QA 
tests in PDI and JRI. JRI should normally be restricted to quantitative checks only, 
except where check proof is required to be carried out. SHQ, along with QA agencies, 
should ensure that only necessary tests are undertaken during PDI/JRI and not the 
complete parameters as evaluated during FET. In case PDI/JRI are planned to be 
conducted by authorised Third Party Inspection (TPI) Agencies, the same will be spelt 
out in the QA Instructions and details included in the finalised ATP. 
 
(d) 
Details of Authority Holding Sealed Particulars (AHSP). 
The 
QA 
Instructions will also give out the details of the nominated AHSP and time for handing 

38 
 
over required particulars to the AHSP, if applicable and should not delay the 
acceptance inspection due to AHSP issues. In case the acceptance is delayed beyond 
15 days, the total period of delay will be excluded from the delivery period of the 
vendor. 
 
(e) 
In case, the procurement is being done for more than one service, the QA of 
the lead service will be responsible for all QA aspects for the entire case, to include 
PDI and JRI for the entire quantities. 
 
Transfer of Technology (ToT) 
 
47. 
In cases where ToT is being sought, SHQ, in consultation with nominated Public 
Sector PA/DRDO (private sector PA) and other stakeholders as applicable, would prepare 
detailed ToT requirements, as applicable, for inclusion in RFP as follows:- 
 
(a) 
Technologies to be acquired along with the range and depth of ToT to cover 
technology for design/development and manufacture of systems, sub-systems, 
assemblies, components, materials etc by Indian ToT partner as well as for repair, 
overhaul, besides production from Completely Knocked Down (CKD)/Semi Knocked 
Down (SKD) kits, production from raw material and component level. Care should be 
taken that the RFP clearly brings out the verifiable scope of range and depth of ToT 
required. Aspects to be included in the RFP are given at Appendix G to Schedule I. 
 
(b) 
Minimum threshold of Indigenous Content (IC) to be achieved in the Project. 
Vendors will be asked to furnish an ‘Indigenisation Plan’ indicating proposed stage 
wise IC.  
(c)

facility or enter into Joint Venture with Indian companies to progressively 
manufacture their equipment, systems, sub-systems, assemblies, components, spares, 
materials etc in India. 
 
Note.  AoN according authority may choose to incentivise enhanced ToT or IC, on 
case to case basis. Details of such proposals are to be included in the SoC, at the time 
of seeking AoN, and the Incentivisation model is to be incorporated in the RFP. 
Incentive will only be payable post proper verification of enhanced ToT/IC. If such 
incentivisation is proposed to be included in L-1 determination, suitable penalties for 
failure to deliver enhanced ToT or IC, must be defined upfront in RFP and Contract. 

39 
 
ToT For Maintenance Infrastructure  
 
48. 
For Buy & Make (Indian) and Buy (Global) category cases, the provision of ToT to an 
Indian vendor for setting-up maintenance infrastructure would be approved by AoN 
according authority.  The RFP would spell out specific requirements of ToT for Maintenance 
Infrastructure covering all/any of the following aspects:- 
 
(a) 
Ensure Indian entity is able to support operation and deployment of the 
platform/equipment on sustainable basis. 
 
(b) 
Ensure Indian entity is self-sustainable to provide ‘Intermediate’, ‘Depot’ and 
‘Overhaul’ level repairs, maintenance and upgrade for entire life cycle of equipment.

would be implemented under long term contract.  The proposal for Maintenance Transfer of 
Technology (MToT) shall also include Active Obsolescence Management through Life 
Cycle Support of the equipment including upgradation of system/subsystem/components on 
completion of its fair service life. 
 
50. 
Indian Entity. 
The Indian entity could be a Government agency such as 
entities like OFB/ Army Base Workshops /Naval Dockyards/Naval Aircraft Yards/ Base 
Repair Depots of Air Force/DPSUs/ other Govt agencies or Indian Private Vendor.  In case it 
is a Government agency, this entity would be identified and would be included in the SoC 
submitted to the AoN according authority for accord of AoN.  Existing technical 
arrangements if any, of the foreign OEMs with Indian industry, may be taken cognisance of.  
In case MToT is being transferred to Indian private firms, the AoN according authority may 
permit foreign vendors to partner a suitable Indian industry of their choice.  Wherever 
required, the broad eligibility criteria for selection of Indian private firms as MToT partner 
may also be included in the RFP. 
 
Product Support 
 
51. 
To sustain and support platform/equipment through its operational life cycle, SHQ 
will ensure that Product Support requirements for atleast 3 to 5 years beyond the warranty 
period will be procured along with the main equipment. Foreign OEM (FOEM) may utilise 
their ‘wholly owned in-country entity’ to provide the desired product support without dilution 

40 
 
of the Seller’s obligation to execute contracted liabilities. The equipment could be provided 
product support through any one or combination of the following details which are elucidated 
in subsequent paragraphs and details given at Appendix F of this Chapter:- 
 
(a) 
Engineering Support Package (ESP).

RFP Vetting And Issue  
 
52. 
The procedure for RFP vetting and issue will be as follows:- 
 
(a) 
Preparation of Draft RFP.  
All activities internal to SHQ for 
preparation of RFP, which includes consultation with all agencies concerned such as 
Procurement and Maintenance directorates at SHQ, QA agencies, DRDO etc. would 
be completed prior to consideration of the case by AoN according authority. All issues 
identified after internal vetting of draft RFP at SHQ, which merit incorporation, will 
be included for consideration in the SoC for accord of AoN. 
 
(b) 
Comments on Draft RFP. 
 
Concurrent to circulation of SoC being 
fielded to the AoN according authority, copies of draft RFP will be forwarded by SHQ 
to concerned JS & AM, ADG Acquisition Technical and FM for the non-delegated 
power cases, and ADG Acquisition Technical and IFA (Capital)/ PIFA for delegated 
power cases along with other stakeholders. Observations, if any, will be intimated to 
the SHQ within four weeks, based on which the draft RFP will be amended 
accordingly. SHQ may also interact with vendors/industry at the draft RFP stage, so 
that in case any changes are felt necessary, these are incorporated prior to issuance of 
RFP. 
 
(c) 
Collegiate Vetting and Approval. 
Single stage collegiate vetting of RFP 
and finalisation of Vendor List will be done after the accord of AoN in a RFP Vetting 
Collegiate comprising of JS & AM, ADG Acquisition Technical, FM, representatives 
of SHQ and QA agency in non-delegated power cases, and representatives of ADGs 
Acquisition Technical, SHQ, QA agency and IFA(Capital) in all delegated power 
cases. Advisor/Director (Cost) will be member of the RFP Collegiate Vetting of non-
delegated/delegated power cases respectively. Post the Collegiate Vetting, the draft 
RFP, duly amended, will be forwarded for approval of DG (Acquisition)/CISC 

41 
 
/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DGICG (as applicable) along with the minutes of the 
collegiate meetings through respective ADG Acquisition Technical. 
 
(d) 
Issue of RFP.  
Post approval, RFP in all cases will be issued by the 
respective ADG Acquisition Technical. No addition to the vendors list would be 
allowed after issue of the RFP.  
 
53. 
Pre Bid Queries and Bid Submission. 
Twelve weeks from date of issue of RFP, 
will normally be given to the vendors for submission of bids. However, in nominated SVC 
and Repeat Order/Option Clause cases, the time for submission of bids will not be more than 
eight weeks. Consequent to the issue of RFP, a number of queries relating to the RFP may be 
raised by the vendors. It should be ensured that all the queries are answered in an acceptable 
time frame so that the vendors are able to submit their techno-commercial offers by the due 
date. Pre-bid meeting(s) of all the vendors would be conducted by the User Directorate along 
with representatives from Procurement Directorate of SHQ, representatives of Defence Offset 
Management Wing (DOMW) for Offset matters, representatives of PA for ToT/MToT 
matters, representatives of trial agencies for trial methodology related issues, representatives 
of JS & AM, ADG Acquisition Technical and FM (for non-delegated cases)/IFA(Capital) (for 
delegated power cases). The clarifications should be processed by the SHQ and be given in 
writing to all the vendors by the concerned ADG Acquisition Technical preferably within 
three weeks of the pre-bid meeting. In case a need arises to modify the RFP owing to 
typographical errors, the amendment will be issued after due approval of the DG(Acquisition) 
for non-delegated cases and CISC/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DGICG in delegated power cases. 
In all other cases, amendments to the RFP may be issued after approval of AoN according 
authority, provided that the change does not put any vendor at a disadvantage. Copies of such 
amendment/modification would be simultaneously sent to all vendors to whom RFP has been 
issued. After such amendments, the time and date of submission bids may also be extended 
suitably, with the approval of the AoN according authority/DG(Acquisition)/CISC /VCOAS 
/VCNS/DCAS/DGICG, as the case may be. 
 
Offer Opening 
 
54. 
Offer Opening Committee.  
In cases of Techno Commercial RFP, the bids 
received will be opened on the notified date & time by the Offer Opening Committee chaired 
by the ADG Acquisition Technical/SHQ, in the presence of the bidders or their authorised 
representatives, as may choose to be present. The Committee will open the envelope 
containing the sealed technical and commercial offers. The technical offers will be opened by 
the committee and sent to SHQ for evaluation by a Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) 
and the unopened sealed commercial offers will be sent to the AM/SHQ. In cases where only 
a Commercial RFP has been issued, the Offer Opening Committee will forward the Technical 
Compliance received from the vendor(s) to the SHQ for confirming the same. SHQ will 
forward the confirmation or otherwise to the technical compliance within one week to the 
Chairman of the CNC. Offers which do not conform to the prescribed procedure for 
submission of offers or are not accompanied with all requisite documents, as laid down in 

42 
 
Schedule I of Chapter II or which are received after the scheduled time for submission of 
offers or unsolicited offers i.e. other than those vendors to whom a RFP has been issued, will 
not be accepted. 
 
55. 
Single Vendor Situation. 
In multiple vendor cases, if a single bid is received at 
the bid submission stage, SHQ may proceed with the process and complete the TEC without 
retracting the RFP. Such cases will be referred directly to the AoN according authority within 
four weeks from the acceptance of the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) report. In case 
it is concluded that any change in SQRs would not meet the operational requirements of the 
Service; or any change in other conditions of the RFP is unlikely to increase the vendor base; 
or it may inordinately delay the procurement, then the case may be progressed with the 
approval of AoN according authority, provided the vendor agrees to hold the original 
commercial bid till completion of the procurement process. In such single vendor situation, 
efforts should be made to complete the acquisition process before expiry of original validity 
of commercial bid.  
 
56. 
Buy and Make (Indian) Cases. 
In case of ‘Buy and Make (Indian)’ category, 
situations may arise in which all bids submitted by Indian vendors, indicate a collaboration 
with a single foreign vendor. Such cases have to be discussed and deliberated by the AoN 
according authority and if it is concluded that there is no scope for change in SQRs and other 
conditions of the RFP; and that retraction and reissue of RFP is not likely to increase the 
vendor base, then the case may be progressed with the approval of the AoN according 
authority.  
 
57. 
Extension of Time for Submission of Bids.  
No extension of time will be 
provided under normal circumstances. However, situations may arise in which it may be 
appropriate to extend the time allowed for submission of offers. If an extension is being 
sought by the vendor, the request with justification must be received by the ADG Acquisition 
Technical/SHQ concerned from the vendor at least two weeks prior to bid submission date, 
failing which such requests may not be entertained. Extension of upto four weeks could be 
given by SHQ and the approval for further extension has to be sought from the DG 
(Acquisition)/CISC/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DGICG 
as 
per 
applicability 
of 
Non 
Delegated/Delegated Power Cases.  
 
Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC)  
 
58. 
A TEC will be constituted by the SHQ for evaluation of the technical bids received in 
response to the RFP. The TEC will include representatives of the User Service, Maintenance 
Agency and QA agency. Representative of FM (in non delegated cases) and PIFA/IFA 
(Capital) (in delegated power cases) will also be part of the TEC to verify financial criteria as 
laid down for Vendor Selection Criteria, if applicable. In addition, cases where ToT is 
involved, TEC may also include representatives of PA nominated by AoN according authority 
for absorption of ToT/ DRDO (in cases involving ToT or Indigenous design).  
 

43 
 
59. 
Evaluation of Technical Offer. 
TEC 
will 
examine 
the 
extent 
of 
variations/differences, if any, in the characteristics of the equipment offered by various 
vendors with reference to the QRs as given at Appendix A to Schedule I and prepare a 
‘Compliance Statement’ short listing the equipment for trials/induction into service, as 
applicable. TEC will also examine compliance of vendors to provisions of RFP as listed at 
Appendix B to Schedule I. Non-compliance of vendors to any of the required provisions 
would lead to rejection of the bid at this stage. Cases where ToT for maintenance 
infrastructure to an Indian entity is sought, the TEC will examine the joint compliance of the 
OEM and the Indian entity for establishing the required maintenance infrastructure as laid 
down in the RFP. In cases where an OEM bids, along with other vendors supplying the same 
product as that of the OEM, only the bid of the OEM will be accepted. However, in Buy 
(Global) and Buy (Global - Manufacture in India) categories, Indian vendors offering FOEM 
product will also be permitted to bid along with the FOEM. 
 
60. 
Vendor Interaction.  
The 
TEC 
may 
invite 
the 
vendors 
for 
presentations/clarifications on technical issues. A technical offer, once submitted, should not 
undergo subsequent material changes. However, minor variations which do not affect the 
basic character/profile of the offer may be acceptable, under the following conditions:- 
 
(a) 
To ensure fair play, an opportunity to revise minor technical details should be 
accorded to all vendors in equal measure.  
 
(b) 
No extra time to be given to any vendor to upgrade their product; except in 
case of Essential Parameters-B. 
 
(c) 
No dilution of SQR is carried out. 
 
(d) 
Original commercial quote submitted earlier cannot be revised by the vendor.  
 
61. 
Approval of TEC Report. 
 
TEC should be concluded within four weeks of 
its constitution and its report submitted to the concerned procurement directorate in the SHQ. 
Approval of the TEC Report will be done within the SHQ in all cases, except where any 
vendor(s) is found non-compliant or cases involving ToT or cases with additional reward for 
higher IC, wherein approval of DG (Acquisition)/CISC/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DGICG for 
non-delegated/delegated power cases respectively will be obtained through respective ADG 
Acquisition Technical. 
 
62. 
Single Vendor Situation. 
In multi-vendor cases, a single vendor situation may 
emerge post technical evaluation by TEC. The procurement process may be continued as 
planned provided the vendor agrees not to revise the commercial bid, during the remaining 
part of the acquisition process. SHQ will examine reasons for this single vendor situation, 
record the same in their report and submit the report to the AoN according authority. In case it 
is concluded that any change in SQRs would not meet the operational requirements of the 
Services; or any change in other conditions of the RFP is unlikely to increase the vendor base, 

44 
 
or it may inordinately delay the procurement, then the case may be progressed with the 
approval of the AoN according authority, provided the vendor agrees to hold the original 
commercial bid till completion of the procurement process. In such situation, efforts should 
be made to complete the acquisition process before expiry of original validity of commercial 
bid. 
 
63. 
Sharing of Details of Technical Bid. 
To ensure timely completion of the trial 
evaluation process, Certification of Conformance (CoC) along with test standards and test 
results, graphs and accredited lab certifications and draft ATP submitted by vendor as part of 
the Technical bid, where applicable, would be shared with representative(s) of QA and EMI/ 
EMC Evaluation agency at the commencement of the TEC. Respective trial agency, after 
consultation with SHQ, would reserve the right to undertake random/sample test to validate 
the CoC submitted by the vendor/OEM during FET. 
 
Technical Offset Evaluation Committee (TOEC) 
 
64. 
The Technical Offset Evaluation Committee (TOEC) will be constituted by the 
concerned ADG Acquisition Technical with approval of the DG (Acquisition), wherever 
applicable. The TOEC will be chaired by JS (DOMW) and will include representatives of the 
SHQ, FM and DRDO. The Committee may also include experts as may be deemed necessary 
with approval of the DG (Acquisition). The TOEC Report will be forwarded by the Chairman 
to DG (Acquisition) for acceptance, through the concerned ADG Acquisition Technical. 
 
Field Evaluation Trials (FET)  
 
65. 
FET for equipment of all TEC compliant vendors will be conducted by SHQ on the 
basis of Trial Methodology given in the RFP. The conduct of trials will be based on the 
principles of transparency, fairness, equal opportunities to all and meticulous attention to 
details. Parameters evaluated at TEC stage, based on documents or certificates rendered by 
accredited agencies, may not be included in the FET. Guidelines with regards to FET related 
aspects are attached at Appendix G to this Chapter. 
 
66. 
Conduct of FET. 
FET will not be conducted as a process of elimination but with 
an objective to nurture competition. The primary focus of the evaluation should, therefore, be 
towards testing the equipment based on its anticipated employability. Wherever feasible, the 
entire trials should be conducted simultaneously in order to save time. All efforts should be 
made to get adequate pieces of the equipment, to allow concurrent trials, through the RFP. 
All shortlisted vendors would be asked to provide their equipment for trials in India, except 
when trials are to be conducted at vendor premises abroad.  In cases where the trials are 
planned abroad, approval of AoN according authority is to be sought at the time of seeking 
AoN. FET would consist of all or any of the following trials:- 
 
(a)  
User Trials.  
 

45 
 
(b)  
Technical Trials i.e. DGQA Evaluation including Environmental testing.  
 
(c)  
Maintainability Evaluation Trials (MET). 
 
(d)  
Electro Magnetic Compatibility (EMC)/Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) 
Evaluation.  
(e) 
Secrecy Testing – where required.  
 
67. 
Non Applicability of Trials.  
FET/NCNC Trials will not be applicable for 
procurement cases where there is no prototype available for conduct of NCNC Trials as is the 
case in acquisition/construction of Ships, Submarines, Yard Craft, Tugs, Ferry Craft and 
Barges (only for capacity cleared yards). FET/NCNC Trials will also not be applicable for 
simulators being built for the first time where there is no possibility of testing on a similar 
existing simulator. However, Technical Evaluation and Delivery Acceptance Trials for these 
will be carried out. Commercially Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment, meeting requisite 
IS/BIS or equivalent certifications, may be accepted on the basis of vendor certification 
without conduct of Technical, EMI-EMC and MET.  
 
68. 
Simulation Based Trials. 
In cases where trials are not visualised or where field 
evaluation is not feasible due to terrain, time or operational restrictions, there may be 
possibility of conducting evaluation through computer simulations or documented historical 
data of validation of the parameters produced by the vendor. In such cases, the exact scope of 
the trials shall be included in the SoC while seeking the AoN. The AoN according authority 
shall debate the scope of trials and approve suitable options, as applicable. 
 
69. 
Trial Directive. 
SHQ, in consultation with TEC compliant vendors, will 
formulate a detailed Trial Directive in conformity with the Trial Methodology given in the 
RFP. The Trial Directive must specify the fundamental points that need to be addressed for 
validation of RFP parameters in terms of ‘Compliance cum Responsibility Matrix’. 
Parameters not mentioned in the RFP will not be included in the Trial Directive and no 
variation to the SQRs will be introduced in the compliance matrix. Responsibility for testing 
each parameter must be fixed for a single agency. Trial Directive, would also list out exact 
location and detailed trial schedule keeping in mind availability of the requisite infrastructure 
(ranges/labs), as also readiness of vendors. Parameters/tests acceptable by certification 
through accredited labs will be clearly specified in the Trial Directive. Respective trial 
agency, after consultation with SHQ, would however reserve the right to undertake 
random/sample test to confirm the certified parameters. The nomination of the Trial 
Wing/Team will also be done in the Trial Directive. 
 
70. 
Trial Wings/Teams.  SHQ should preferably setup Trial Wings at Training 
Institutions/Establishments for their respective arms/services and trials should be conducted 
under the aegis of these wings. However, where ever such establishments are not available, as 
in cases of Navy and Air Force, SHQ may follow norms/procedures in vogue. 
Representatives of QA agencies, EMI-EMC Cell and Maintainability Evaluation Trials 

46 
 
(where applicable) may be co-opted, based on requirement. Endeavours should, however, be 
made by all Services to establish dedicated Trial Nodes at the earliest. In cases, where the 
equipment is being procured for more than one Service, the Trial Team will have 
representatives of each Service for whom equipment is being procured, headed by 
representative from the Lead Service. For trials of equipment involving ToT, representative of 
Production Agency (PA)/Development cum Production Partner (DcPP), may be included as 
an Associate Member. In certain cases, SHQ may conduct concurrent trials by constituting a 
Composite Trial Team (CTT), comprising of representatives of the User, QA agency, 
Maintenance agency and EMI/EMC evaluating agency, in order to hasten the evaluation 
process. 
 
71. 
Multi-Disciplinary Technical Delegation (MDTD). 
In 
certain 
cases, 
particularly in those involving integration of systems or sensitive equipment, there may be a 
need to depute a MDTD for carrying out evaluation abroad and the same may be constituted 
post approval of the AoN according authority. An Empowered Committee could also be 
deputed along with MDTD for negotiation purposes.  The delegation will have 
representatives from the User service, Maintenance agency, QA agency and the concerned 
ADG Acquisition Technical.  In addition, JS & AM and FM or their representatives for non-
delegated cases and IFA (Capital) / PIFA for delegated power cases may be included in the 
Empowered Committee.  
 
72. 
Submission of Equipment Under Trial (EUT). 
Vendors will be asked to field the 
desired number of units of the equipment/ weapon system for FET as per dates promulgated 
in the Trial Directive.  Vendor(s) failing to produce equipment by date decided in the Trial 
Directive may be given a grace period of 30 days authorised by the concerned PSO at the 
SHQ 
and 
additional 
grace 
period 
of 
up 
to 
30 
days 
approved 
by 
the 
CISC/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DGICG, on a case to case basis. Equal opportunity would be 
provided to all vendors while granting such grace period.  Vendors, who fail to produce the 
EUT even after providing 60 days grace period would be asked to explain reasons for the 
same and in case these are found satisfactory by SHQ, case for granting grace period beyond 
60 days would be processed by SHQ for approval of DG (Acquisition). To prevent deliberate 
delays in fielding the equipment by the vendor(s), the Trial Directive may include a provision 
of disqualifying vendors who fail to position the equipment on time. EUT not fielded at the 
start of trials would not be considered at a later point of time.  In an eventuality where only 
one vendor has submitted the equipment, the case may be progressed as Resultant Single 
Vendor after approval of the AoN according authority. (Also refer to Paragraph 43 above) 
 
73. 
Joint Trials. Single OEM equipment being fielded by multiple Indian vendors may 
have joint trials if two or more Indian vendors so desire.  Indian vendors who agree to field 
the equipment jointly may do so after providing an undertaking that they will accept the trial 
results.   
 
74. 
User Trials. 
Trials will be conducted only pertaining to conditions where the 
equipment is most likely to be deployed. In other conditions where the probability of 

47 
 
deployment is not high, appropriate vendor certifications confirming the functional 
effectiveness under such conditions may be obtained and simulations based testing may be 
resorted to wherever applicable. Equipment fielded may require repairs/modifications during 
the course of trials and these in situ servicing, repair, maintenance actions or modifications as 
requested by the vendor will be permitted. Towards this, vendors shall be adequately 
informed and advised at the pre trial stage itself so that they can ensure availability of 
requisite maintenance teams/ experts on site during the conduct of trials. SHQ may also 
accord permission for trial equipment to move out of the trial location for a defined period for 
such repairs or modifications on a case to case basis. In Single Vendor Cases, permission for 
the above may be permitted by the OIC Trials itself. 
 
75. 
Technical Trials.  Technical trials will be conducted by QA agency to assess 
conformance to the quality requirements, standards and specifications. As far as possible, 
physical evaluation and environmental tests will only be carried out for critical parameters 
and other parameters will be evaluated based on vendor certification duly supported by 
certification by NABL accredited laboratories/internationally recognised laboratories. The 
same will be clearly spelt out in the Trial Directive. Towards this, vendor will submit the 
technical documentation and draft ATP as part of technical bid or at least one month before 
commencement of FET. QA Agency will finalise the ATP in respect of all participating 
vendors during Technical Trials. 
 
76. 
Maintainability Evaluation Trials (MET).  
MET to address maintenance, 
repair and spares support aspects of acquisition should preferably be undertaken through the 
OEM documentation concurrent to the User Trials.  Only essential tests focussing towards 
establishing maintainability should be carried out to establish adequacy of maintenance tools, 
test equipment and spares utilisation. Actual stripping of the equipment should only be 
undertaken where considered of absolute necessity by the User. Failure in MET should, 
preferably, not be criteria for rejection and the Vendor will be given a maximum of two 
additional opportunities  to ensure compliance within a definite period of time including 
certification by vendor for submission at delivery/FoPM stage, failing which such vendor 
would be non-compliant. 
 
77. 
EMC/ EMI Evaluation.  
EMC/ EMI Evaluation would be carried out by 
designated testing centers like Army Center for Electromagnetics (ACE), Mhow etc. based on 
desired standards as given out in the Trial Directive. In most cases, evaluation of only those 
parameters having direct bearing on the operational employability of the equipment should be 
carried out and certification of accredited labs may be accepted for the remainder parameters. 
 
78. 
Validation at Vendor Premises Abroad. 
It may emerge during the process of 
trials in India that certain validations need to be carried out abroad at the vendor premises 
owing to export restrictions, security related issues, availability of testing infrastructure/ 
platforms or such like reasons.  SHQ will seek permission for conduct of such validations to 
be carried out abroad from the DG (Acquisition) for non-delegated cases and 
CISC/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DGICG for delegated cases.   

48 
 
79. 
Debriefing of Vendors. 
After each stage of the trials, a debriefing of all the 
vendors would be carried out by the evaluating agency with regards to the performance of 
their equipment. Compliance or otherwise, vis-à-vis parameters listed in the trial directive, 
would be specifically communicated to all the vendors at the trial location itself.  It would 
also be ensured that all verbal communication with the vendors is confirmed in writing within 
a week and all such correspondences are recorded and documented. 
 
80. 
Trial Report.  
Trial Reports submitted by all evaluating agencies must give 
unambiguous Compliance / Non-Compliance to RFP parameters evaluated by that Agency. It 
will be ensured that comments and recommendations are restricted to RFP parameters only.  
 
81. 
Confirmatory Trials.  
On completion of all trials, when no equipment has 
fully met all the RFP parameters, but there is reason to believe, that vendors would be able to 
quickly overcome the drawbacks noticed, confirmatory trials may be conducted by the SHQ. 
In multi vendor cases, confirmatory trials will be conducted with the approval of concerned 
PSO at SHQ. However, in Single Vendor cases, the OIC Trials will be authorised to order 
confirmatory trials in specified time period. A separate Trial Directive will be issued for 
conduct of confirmatory trials which must be specific about what needs to be checked. 
Vendors may be permitted to take the equipment to their premises for repairs / modifications, 
prior to fielding it in the confirmatory trials. Vendors could also be permitted to field a new 
piece of equipment for confirmatory trials within a stipulated time, on a case to case basis. In 
cases where modification undertaken by the vendor affects results of other parameters, these 
affected parameters will also need to be re-evaluated. 
  
82. 
Overseeing of Trials.  In order to provide timely guidance to trial teams in 
overcoming impediments encountered, SHQ will depute suitable representatives, associated 
with preparation of Trial Methodology/Directive, to oversee the trials. In addition, the 
Officer-in-Charge or a senior member of the Trial Team may also be called to SHQ for 
central briefing, to better understand the scope and extent of the trials. Representative of the 
concerned ADG Acquisition Technical may also oversee the FET as observers. 
 
83. 
Timelines. 
The Trial Methodology should ensure that FET is completed within a 
standard time period of 16 to 24 weeks (additional 12 weeks for winter trials). However, SHQ 
may seek additional time during accord of AoN owing to nature and scope of the trials. In 
case of delay, SHQ will update the under mentioned authorities as follows: - 
 
 
(a)  DG (Acquisition) (for non-delegated cases) 
- for slippage beyond six months
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b)  CISC/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DGICG   
- for slippage beyond six months 
(for delegated cases)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c)  AoN According authority  
 
 
- for slippage beyond 12 months 
 

49 
 
84. 
Benchmark Models Committee.  
On receipt of Trial Report by SHQ, concurrent 
benchmarking will be carried out by a Benchmark Models Committee headed by the Advisor 
(Cost)/Director (Cost) in non-delegated/delegated cases respectively and representatives of 
concerned SHQ Directorates, as per guidelines issued by Principal Advisor (Cost) and as 
amended from time to time. This process will be automatically undertaken once SHQ informs 
Advisor (Cost) /Director (Cost) about receipt of Trial Report. Along with this information, 
SHQ will also provide Advisor (Cost) /Director (Cost) with details of representatives of SHQ 
Directorates nominated as members of the concerned Benchmark Models Committee. The 
recommendations of the Benchmark Models Committee may be accepted as such/deliberated 
upon by the CNC post approval of GS Evaluation and promulgation of CNC. Till then, the 
Benchmark Models Committee benchmark models and costing data will be kept in a sealed 
cover with the Chairman, CNC. 
 
85. 
Costing Committee for DPSUs/OFB. 
In cases where DPSU/OFB equipment is 
being procured in a Single Vendor Case or as BNE, on recommendations of the CNC, a 
Costing Committee constituted by DDP will price the DPSU/OFB equipment post successful 
completion of trials and forward the same to the concerned AM /SHQ chairing the CNC. 
Such pricing by the Costing Committee shall take into account economies of scales and shall 
have validity of three years from its date of promulgation and such price may be adopted by 
the CNC. The CNC may not furnish reasonability of cost certificate for such DPSU/OFB 
items. 
 
86. 
Costing Committee for JVs Through IGAs. 
In cases where procurement is 
undertaken from a Joint Venture between an Indian DPSU/OFB/ DRDO and a Foreign/ 
Domestic Entity, formed on the basis of an IGA or otherwise, nominated as Single Vendor, a 
Committee constituted based on the approval of DG(Acquisition), may be tasked to carry out 
fixation of reasonable price for basic version of the product being procured. It will be 
incumbent upon the JV to share its Costing data with the Costing Committee, as and when 
requested. The Costing Committee will submit its report to the DG (Acquisition) in these 
cases and the CNC will establish reasonability of the overall cost. 
 
Staff Evaluation  
 
87. 
Approval of GS Evaluation.  
The Staff Evaluation will analyse the field 
evaluation results and shortlist the equipment recommended for introduction into Service. 
Approval of the GS Evaluation will be done within the SHQ in all cases, except where any 
vendor(s) is found non-compliant or cases involving ToT or cases with additional reward for 
higher IC, wherein approval of DG (Acquisition)/CISC/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DGICG for 
non-delegated/delegated power cases respectively will be obtained through respective ADG 
Acquisition Technical, prior to progressing the case further. Issues, if any, raised by the ADG 
Acquisition Technical on the Staff Evaluation Report, should be addressed in a collegiate 
manner within the SHQ. After due examination, the ADG Acquisition Technical will submit 
the report to the DG (Acquisition)/CISC/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DGICG for non-delegated 
and delegated power cases respectively, with recommendations for acceptance or otherwise. 

50 
 
In case no vendor meets the SQRs in the FET, then the case would be foreclosed and RFP 
retracted on approval of DG (Acquisition)/CISC/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DGICG for non-
delegated/delegated power cases through respective ADG Acquisition Technical.   
 
88. 
Cases, in which bids have been submitted by more than one bidder in a competitive 
manner and the Staff Evaluation shortlists only one equipment for ‘Introduction into service’, 
would not be considered as a single vendor situation. In these cases, the commercial bids 
were submitted in an open competition before the trials and the vendors were not aware of a 
single bidder getting approved after the trials.  
 
Technical Oversight Committee 
 
89. 
It is expected that oversight should be part of the normal process of higher level 
approvals within SHQ/ Acquisition Wing. TOC, when constituted, must provide expert 
oversight over the technical evaluation process. The DG (Acquisition) may constitute a TOC 
for acquisition cases in excess of ₹ 300 crores and for any other case recommended by the 
Defence Secretary/DPB/DAC. Technical Oversight through a special committee would be 
resorted to in multivendor cases where a complaint has been received and not for Single 
Vendor Cases and cases where only DPSU(s)/OFB are participating. The TOC will comprise 
of a Convener nominated by the lead SHQ of the rank of Major General/equivalent and one 
member each from two sister services other than the lead agency of the rank of 
Brigadier/equivalent. Members nominated should have adequate seniority and experience and 
should not have been involved with that acquisition case, in any capacity in the past. The 
TOC will be tasked to verify whether prescribed procedure has been followed in the 
procurement case. The TOC will also review and bring out the status of a grievance or 
complaint, if any existing at this stage, pertaining to acquisition scheme and will have to give 
its observations and recommendations, based on a majority decision, within 30 days, which 
may be extended by a maximum period of 30 days, with the consent of the DG(Acquisition). 
ADG Acquisition Technical of the Acquisition Wing will provide the Secretarial support to 
the TOC and ensure availability of all inputs from DDP/Acquisition Wing, Def (Fin) and 
SHQ to the TOC. The SHQ will clarify any queries raised by the TOC. The TOC report will 
be submitted to the Defence Secretary for approval. In case of complaints, cases may be 
referred to the nominated Independent Expert Monitors (IEMs) by the Acquisition Wing/any 
other department of the MoD or initiated suo-moto by the vendors/any other agency. Post 
analysis, the IEMs report will be submitted to the Acquisition Wing. All reports opined by the 
IEMs as vexatious or frivolous or lacking cogent evidence will be put up for acceptance of 
the Defence Secretary. IEM Reports which ascertain genuineness of the complaint and 
recommend that cognisance of the complaint/action be taken, the same will be forwarded to 
the Raksha Mantri for acceptance. 
 
Intimation to Vendors 
 
90. 
The ADGs Acquisition Technical would provide intimation to all participating 
vendors about their respective status post acceptance of TEC/Staff Evaluation/Technical 

51 
 
Oversight Committee Report (if TOC is held). Intimation to vendors with regard to Trials will 
be done by the conducting SHQ. 
 
Procurement of Already Inducted Equipment 
 
91. 
To enhance standardisation and reduce inventory cost, as also training effort, Services 
may opt to procure equipment/systems/platforms already inducted into Service through the 
original OEM/vendors. These cases would not be construed as ab-initio Single Vendor Case 
and could be on basis of ‘Option Clause’, ‘Repeat Order’ or ‘Upgrade’ cases. These would be 
fielded directly to the AoN according authority, depending upon the financial value of the 
case. 
 
93. 
Option Clause. 
Where only part quantity of an equipment is being procured, 
SHQ may built-in provision for an ‘Option Clause’ in the main contract to procure additional 
equipment, spares, facilities or services, till last delivery of the main equipment, as per the 
cost, terms and conditions set out in the original contract. Such cases would be included in 
the SoC, at the time of seeking AoN for the initial procurement. While exercising the Option 
Clause, SHQ will examine the viability of the same viz-a-viz fresh procurement and the same 
will be endorsed in the SoC for seeking AoN for the same. All terms and conditions of the 
original contract will apply to the case in which Option Clause is being exercised. Price 
Variation Clause, FERV etc, if applicable and included in the original Contract, will also be 
applicable for Option Clause Contract. For arriving at prices payable, the Price Variation will 
be applied on the Base Contract price of the original Contract with the month and year of 
Effective date of Contract (TC) as Base Level Indices. 
 
92. 
Repeat Order. 
For 
equipment/systems/platforms 
already 
inducted 
into 
service/contracted by DPSUs and PSUs including Shipyards, it may be necessary to go back 
to the OEM/vendors for placing Repeat Orders. AoN for Repeat Orders must be obtained 
within five years of date of completion of warranty on final delivery against the previous 
contract. In such cases it may be ensured that as far as possible the SQRs of the equipment 
are as per the previous order. Repeat Order cases would not be construed as Single Vendor 
Cases. Repeat Order would generally be limited to quantity not exceeding 100% of the 
original contract. Specific approval of DPB (in acquisition cases up to ₹ 500 Crores) or DAC 
(in acquisition cases excess of ₹ 500 Crores) as the case may be, would be obtained for 
Repeat Order of quantity exceeding 100% of the original order quantities.  Repeat Order 
cases may fall under any of the following categories:- 
 
(a) 
Additional Quantities.  
This may be necessitated to make up for 
deficiency in the existing scaling or to cater for the requirements due to new 
Raisings/War Wastage Reserves (WWR)/Sector Stores.  
 
(b) 
Replacement Equipment.  This may be necessitated due to equipment 
declared ‘Beyond Economical Repairs’ (BER) or damages or loss to the earlier 
equipment by way of accidents/natural calamities or such like reasons. 

52 
 
(c) 
Major-assemblies/sub-assemblies/Special Maintenance Tools (SMT)/Special 
Test Equipment (STE)/maintenance/integration of Buyer Furnished Equipment (BFE). 
 
(d) 
Spares for All Levels of Maintenance.  
It must, however, be ensured that 
when 
spares 
etc, 
are 
procured 
from 
OEMs 
of 
sub-assemblies, 
the 
assurances/warranties extended by the OEM for the main equipment retain their 
validity.  
 
93. 
Repeat Order of Other Services/Agencies.  
If equipment proposed to be 
procured has already been procured by a sister Service, Border Roads Organisation (BRO), 
other MoD agencies, other Government agencies (i.e. DPSUs/ PSUs including shipyards),   
Paragraph Military Forces (PMF), ARC/NTRO, Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) or any 
other Law Enforcement agency, after following due process, then such cases would be treated 
as Repeat Order.  
 
94. 
Repeat Order with Change in SQRs. 
Repeat 
Order 
cases, 
related 
to 
obsolescence management and product/technology improvement involving changes in SQRs, 
may be accorded approval by the DAC. 
 
95. 
Upgrades. 
Due to constant changes in technology, various weapons, equipment, 
etc. which are already in service, may need to be upgraded/refurbished/modified/overhauled 
to incorporate advancements in technology. All cases, where an upgrade to an in Service 
weapon system/equipment is being planned through the OEM/Vendor (view proprietary 
equipment or where the OEM/Vendor is offering to upgrade the same equipment as part of 
Life-Cycle Support, etc), will also follow the ‘Repeat Order’ procedure. 
 
96. 
Validation Trials. 
In cases of ‘Option Clause’ and ‘Repeat Order’, generally no 
FET would be conducted and only a commercial RFP would be issued to the vendor. 
However, limited Validation trials for cases involving changes to SQRs/upgrades may be 
conducted after including the same in the SoC while seeking AoN. 
 
Contract Negotiation Committee (CNC)  
 
97. 
Constitution.  
The 
CNC 
will 
be 
constituted 
after 
the 
TEC/Staff 
Evaluation/TOC report, as applicable, has been accepted. CNCs in Non Delegated cases will 
be chaired by the respective AMs, while Delegated Power cases upto ₹ 150 crores will be 
chaired by a Brigadier or equivalent officer of the SHQ and cases above ₹ 150 crores to 300 
crores will be chaired by a Major General or equivalent officer of the SHQ. In cases where 
there is no FET, the CNC would be constituted within a week of acceptance of TEC Report 
by the competent authority. The standard composition of the CNC is as indicated at Appendix 
H to this Chapter. Suitable technical member(s) may be co-opted by the Chairman to 
negotiate Life Cycle Support Contract (where applicable), along with the Main Contract. Any 
change in the composition of the CNC may be effected with the approval of DG 
(Acquisition) and CISC/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DGICG for non-delegated and delegated 

53 
 
power cases respectively. Where considered necessary, a Service officer or any officer other 
than from the Acquisition Wing of the MoD may be nominated as Chairman of the CNC with 
the prior approval of RM. Organisations/agencies concerned should ensure that their 
representatives in the CNC have adequate background and authority to take a decision 
without any need to refer back to their organisation/agency. 
 
98. 
Benchmarking. 
In all cases, CNC will deliberate/accept recommendations of 
the Benchmark Models Committee and establish reasonability of the benchmarked price, in 
an internal meeting before opening the commercial offer. Wherever necessary, additional 
inputs from other sources may be obtained by the CNC. In cases where no field evaluation is 
to be undertaken or there has been oversight in constituting a Benchmark Models Committee 
earlier or proceedings of the Benchmark Models Committee have not been completed, the 
entire benchmarking activity will be undertaken by the CNC itself. In cases where 
DPSU/OFB equipment has been already priced by the Costing Committee constituted under 
DDP for Pricing of DPSU/OFB equipment, such price may be adopted by the CNC and the 
CNC may not furnish reasonability of cost certificate for such DPSU/OFB items.  
 
99. 
Revision of Commercial Bid. 
In cases where the PVC is not applicable, 
situations would arise when the validity of the commercial offers submitted by vendors 
expire before acceptance of Staff Evaluation. In such cases, vendors would be given an 
option to either extend the validity of the commercial offer for a specified period (the period 
to be decided in consultation with SHQ) or to submit fresh commercial proposals except in 
cases where the same is not permitted. For cases where vendors want to submit fresh 
commercial proposal, their old proposals would be returned unopened to them by the 
respective AM/SHQ. 
 
100. 
Opening of Commercial Bids. 
The sealed commercial bids of the compliant 
vendors will be opened by the CNC at a predetermined date and time, previously intimated to 
these vendors. Such vendors or their authorised representatives will be permitted to be 
present during the opening of the commercial bids. The bids of the compliant vendors shall 
be read out to all members present and signed by all members of the CNC.  
 
101. 
Preparation of Compliance Statement. 
The CNC will prepare a ‘Compliance 
Statement’ incorporating the commercial terms offered in the RFP and those sought by the 
vendor(s), analysis of the discordance and the impact of the same. A similar statement would 
be prepared in regard to deviations noticed in the delivery schedules, performance-cum-
warranty/ guarantee provisions, acceptance criteria, Engineering Support Package (ESP), Life 
Cycle Support etc.  
 
102. 
Comparative Statement of Tenders (CST) and Declaration of L1 Vendor. 
The 
CNC would prepare a CST for evaluating the offers and determine the lowest acceptable offer 
(L1 Vendor). Declaration of the L1 Vendor will be done by the CNC at a predetermined date 
and time, previously intimated to these vendors. Such vendors or their authorised 
representatives will be permitted to be present during the opening of the commercial bids.  

54 
 
103. 
Negotiations with L1 Vendor. 
The RFP in multi-vendor cases should clearly 
lay down that no price negotiations would be carried out with the L1 vendor once the 
reasonability of the price quoted by the vendor is established. Once the commercial offers are 
opened and the price of the vendor is found to be within the benchmarked price, there should 
be no need to carry out any further price negotiations.  
 
104. 
Negotiations with L2 Vendor. 
If the bidder, whose bid has been found to be the 
lowest evaluated bid withdraws or whose bid has been accepted, fails to sign the procurement 
contract as may be required, or fails to provide the security as may be required for the 
performance of the contract or otherwise withdraws from the procurement process, the 
Procuring Entity shall cancel the procurement process. Provided that the Procuring Entity, on 
being satisfied that it is not a case of cartelization and the integrity of the procurement 
process has been maintained, may, for cogent reasons to be recorded in writing, offer the next 
successful bidder an opportunity to match the financial bid/negotiated price of the first 
successful bidder, and if the offer is accepted, award the contract to the next successful bidder 
at the financial bid/negotiated price of the first successful bidder, subject to reasonability of 
the price bid being established by the CNC. 
 
105. 
Negotiations in Cases of Splitting of Source of Supply. 
In cases, where specific 
approval has been taken in the AoN to have more than one source of supply, ratio of splitting 
the supply will be pre disclosed in the RFP and negotiations will be done with both the L1 
and L2 vendor, provided the L2 vendor agrees to accept the price and terms and conditions 
quoted by/negotiated with the L1 vendor.  
 
106. 
Previously Contracted Cases. 
Cases in which contracts have earlier been 
signed and benchmark prices are available, the CNC would arrive at the reasonable price, 
taking into consideration the escalation/foreign exchange variation factor. The endeavour 
should be to conclude the CNC early so that the operational/urgent requirement of the 
indenting Service is met in a time-bound manner. For certain category of items, where orders 
have been placed in the past or involves invoking of the Option Clause, there could be 
downward trend of prices since the last contract. It would thus be necessary for the CNC to 
verify that there has been no downward trend since the last purchase and this would have to 
be kept in mind while arriving at the prices.  
 
107. 
Cases Involving Buyer Nominated Equipment (BNE). 
In cases where BNE is 
being procured from a common single source, whether OFB, DPSU or private vendor, the 
commercial bid will clearly indicate the cost of BNE as quoted by DPSU/OFB/private 
vendor, with documentary proof. The scope of BNE cost indicated shall include the basic cost 
of the Main Equipment and OEM Training, Training Aggregates, Documentation, SMT/STE, 
Freight and MRLS as applicable/as indicated in the RFP, which are exclusively sourced from 
the nominated vendor (OEM). L1 in such cases will be determined after deducting the cost of 
the DPSU/OFB/private vendor supplied BNE, from the total cost quoted by the vendor. 
However, payment will be made to the vendor after adding the actual cost of BNE, at the time 
of purchase from DPSU/OFB/private vendor, to the L1 cost determined as mentioned above; 

55 
 
the cost of equipment supplied by DPSUOFB/private vendor will be considered minus GST 
and other taxes and duties. This provision is applicable only in cases where the BNE has to be 
procured from a common single source, whether DPSU, OFB or private vendor and BNE rate 
in such cases would also be separately negotiated with the nominated BNE vendor. If the 
number of single vendor BNE items is large, the RFP Collegiate may restrict the list of items 
to be excluded from L1 determination, based on the total cost of each item and its impact on 
L1 determination and included in the RFP accordingly. 
 
108. 
Offer of Latest Specifications at CNC Stage. 
In 
cases, 
owing 
to 
longer 
gestation time, the L1 vendor may offer latest specifications for obsolescence management of 
the equipment at no additional cost, at the CNC stage. The CNC will be empowered to 
negotiate and recommend acceptance of the same to the CFA provided all parameters are met. 
Limited Validation may accordingly be carried out in these cases by the SHQ on the FoPM 
before grant of BPC. 
 
109. 
Maintenance ToT Contract.  
In 
cases, 
where 
ToT 
for 
Maintenance 
Infrastructure is being sought, the Maintenance Contract involving the OEM and the industry 
receiving the technology would also be negotiated along with the Main Contract.  
 
110. 
Life Cycle Support Contract (LCSC).  
The CNC would also negotiate the terms 
of Life Cycle Support Contract along with the Main Contract, where applicable, and would 
finalise the following with the L1 vendor:- 
 
(a) 
Assured supply of information on product/technological improvement, 
modifications and upgrades. 
 
(b) 
Obsolescence management and life time purchases. 
 
(c) 
An illustrated spares price catalogue with base price and pricing mechanism 
for long term. 
 
(d) 
LCSC would be signed along with the Main Contract and would clearly 
stipulate the obligations of vendor towards provisioning Life Cycle Support for the 
equipment. 
 
111. 
Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP).  
ATP for the equipment of L1 vendor 
finalised during the Technical Trials will be submitted during the process of the CNC and 
included in the draft contract. Details of the Third Party Inspection(TPI) by authorised 
agencies, if applicable, for PDI/JRI will also be finalised in the ATP.(Also refer to Paragraph 
46 above) 
 
112. 
CNC Report.  
The CNC will document the selection of vendor using a formal 
written recommendation report addressed to the relevant approval authority. It should 
comprehensively elaborate the method of evaluation and the rationale for the selection made. 

56 
 
Vetting of the Draft Contract may commence once the L1 vendor is declared. The CNC will 
finalise the Draft Contract before seeking CFA approval taking into consideration any other 
issues that may arise during the course of CNC. The CNC report should also contain the 
Draft Contract Document, duly vetted by all the stakeholders. The report must be complete in 
all respects and should be checked by the members of the CNC. All CNC members should 
sign the recommendation report, in the interest of probity and accountability, as evidence that 
they concur with the process adopted and the ultimate selection made. Any dissenting view, 
including the reasons for the same, should also be documented. The CNC Report should 
include:- 
 
(a) 
A brief background to the requirement. 
 
(b) 
Composition of the CNC.  
 
(c) 
An explanation of the commercial evaluation process, selection criteria and 
commercial evaluation matrices, if used.  
 
(d) 
Brief description of different phases of the commercial negotiation process. 
 
(e) 
Draft Contract Document, duly vetted by all the stakeholders. 
 
(f) 
A summary of the recommendations.  
 
113. 
Processing of CNC Report.  
The CNC Report, along with the summary of 
recommendations, would be processed by respective AM/SHQ, as applicable, for obtaining 
expenditure clearance and CFA approval. In cases where CNC, constituted based on AoN 
cost, negotiates a contract price of higher/lower delegated powers, the proceedings of the 
CNC would be finalised and send to the applicable CFA (as per total contract price) for 
approval along with the Draft Contract Document. 
 
114. 
Return of Commercial Offers.  
For cases where the RFP is retracted after 
submission of the bids or a vendor is rejected at TEC/Trial/Staff Evaluation stage or a vendor 
unilaterally withdraws from the acquisition process, their commercial offers along with BGs 
and PCIP, as submitted, would be returned unopened to such vendors by the ADG Acquisition 
Technical/SHQ. 
 
115. 
CFA Approval. 
The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) has approved 
delegation of financial powers to sanction Capital Acquisition proposals covered in the 
Services Capital Annual Acquisition Plans vide MoD ID No. F. No.470/Dir (Acq)/07 dated 
12 September 2007, attached at Appendix J and last updated vide MoD ID 20(11)/2015-
D(GS-IV) dated 19 February 2019, as follows:- 
 
(a) 
Upto ₹ 300 crores  
 
- CISC, VCOAS, VCNS, DCAS and DGICG 
 

57 
 
(b) 
Above ₹ 300 crores and upto ₹ 500 crores  
- Defence Secretary. 
 
(c) 
Above ₹ 500 crores and upto ₹ 2000 crores  - Raksha Mantri. 
 
(d) 
Above ₹ 2000 crores and upto ₹ 3000 crores  - Finance Minister. 
 
(e) 
Beyond ₹ 3000 crores  
 
 
- CCS. 
 
Award of Contract/Placing of Indents 
 
116. 
Standard Contract Document (SCD).  
The Standard Contract Document at 
Chapter VI indicates the general conditions of contract that would be the guideline for all 
acquisitions. The date of signing of the contract would be the effective date of contract for all 
acquisitions, unless the contract specifies otherwise. The proposed Standard Clauses need not 
be applicable to IGA/ FMS procurements etc. 
 
117. 
Delivery Schedule. 
The date of commencement of delivery schedule would be 
reckoned from the date of release of Advance payment by the Buyer to the Seller, provided 
the Seller submits the documents mandated by the DAP for release of advance by the Buyer 
within 45 days of signing of contract. In the event of the Seller not submitting the said 
documents within 45 days of signing of contract, the period between the 45th day and actual 
submission of documents will be excluded from the actual date of advance payment to arrive 
at the delivery date. In case, no advance is to be paid, the date for reckoning date of delivery 
would be the date of signing of contract. The above will apply to Fast Track Procedure (FTP) 
cases also. This clause will not be applicable in cases wherein Advance payment is released 
after First Off Production Model (FOPM) is successfully validated. In such cases, date of 
accord of Bulk Production Clearance will be the date for reckoning date of delivery. The 
Draft Contract would be prepared as per these guidelines. However, for Single Vendor 
procurements, if there is a situation where Government of India has entered into agreements 
with that country regarding specific contractual clauses, then the terms and conditions of such 
agreements would supersede the corresponding standard clauses of DAP. Consequent to the 
approval of the CFA, the contract(s)(including Offset Contract and Life Cycle Support 
Contract)would be signed by the Acquisition Manager/Director (Procurement) concerned in 
the Acquisition Wing or by an officer authorised by the PSO at the SHQ. 
 
118. 
Placing of Indents. SHQ will obtain AoN for placing of indent on OFB and the 
Competent Authority to place such indents will be as under:- 
 
(a) 
Upto ₹ 300 crores 
 
 
 
- CISC, VCOAS, VCNS,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DCAS and DGICG 
 
(b) 
Above ₹ 300 crores and upto ₹ 500 crores 
- Defence Secretary. 
 
(c) 
Above ₹ 500 crores 
 
 
 
- Raksha Mantri. 

58 
 
 
119. 
Pre Contract Integrity Pact (PCIP).  
All vendors will be required to submit a 
PCIP along with their technical and commercial offers. An Integrity Pact Bank Guarantee 
(IPBG) will also be submitted for all procurement schemes over ₹ 20 crores. Format of the 
PCIP is as given at Annexure I to Appendix M of Schedule I. Post contract, a fresh IPBG 
based on the Contract Price will be submitted by the vendor in place of the IPBG submitted 
along with the bids. DPSUs/OFB are, however, not required to submit PCIP and IPBG when 
nominated as Ab-initio Single Vendors. They shall enter in to a PCIP, on the same lines, with 
its sub-vendors individually in case the estimated value of each sub-contract(s) exceeds ₹ 20 
crores. DPSUs/OFB will submit all BGs, as applicable, while participating in multi vendor 
cases with private vendors. 
 
120. 
Guidelines for putting on Hold, Suspension, Debarment and any other penal action on 
the entities dealing with Ministry of Defence, as promulgated by Government from time to 
time and as hosted on MoD website, will be applicable on procurement process and bidders. 
 
Post-Contract Management 
 
121. 
Post Contract Management involves ensuring compliance with the terms and 
conditions of contract, managing contractual amendments, quality assurance, timely payment 
and deliveries, and resolving claims and disputes. While responsibility for contract 
administration and management would be that of the SHQ concerned, post contract 
monitoring would be conducted by the Acquisition Wing. All issues related to Post Contract 
Management will be governed as per Chapter XI of this DAP. 
 
Change of Name of Vendor 
 
122. 
Whenever a change in vendor name occurs during any stage of procurement process 
(from submission of RFI till execution of complete contract) due to any reason such as 
change 
in 
business 
strategy, 
merger 
and 
acquisitions 
or 
any 
other 
reason, 
guidelines/procedure as given at Appendix K to this Chapter, are to be followed. Whenever a 
vendor applies to regulatory authorities for change of name, it must inform the SHQ User 
Directorate/MoD at the earliest. Notwithstanding the on-going process of change of name of 
any vendor concerned, the procurement process shall continue. On approval of change of 
name of vendor by legal authorities and issuance of new certificate of incorporation by 
Registrar of Companies (ROC)* or any other relevant authority, all relevant documents, self-
authenticated by authorised representative of new vendor (legal entity), must be submitted to 
the SHQ User Directorate/MoD by vendor at the earliest. Also, an undertaking by the new 
vendor as applicable has to be submitted as per the format given in Annexure to Appendix K 
to this chapter. Grant of consent for change of name by authorities concerned at SHQ/MoD is 
subject to submission of all relevant documents. The Acquisition Wing will inform all 
concerned organisations of MoD regarding the change of name of vendor.  
 

59 
 
* Note: Registrar of Companies (ROC) are appointed as per the applicable provisions of 
Companies Act, covering various States and Union Territories of India. For the purpose of 
this paragraph and related appendix and annexure thereof, the term ROC also includes 
relevant regulatory authorities of different countries in case of foreign vendors.  
 
Inter Government Agreement (IGA) 
 
123. 
There may be occasions when procurements would have to be done from friendly 
foreign countries which may be necessitated due to geo-strategic advantages or imperatives 
of strategic partnerships or major military, technological, economic, diplomatic or political 
benefits. These principal factors may determine the choice of a specific platform or 
equipment on a single vendor basis. Such procurements would not classically follow the 
Standard Procurement Procedure and the Standard Contract Document but would be based on 
mutually agreed provisions between the Governments of both the countries. The 
procurements in such cases may be based on technical specifications and testing procedures 
of the OEM itself. Such procurements will be done based on an Inter-Governmental 
Agreement (IGA) after clearance from CFA and would be progressed with approval of AoN 
according authority. The broad procedure for concluding of an IGA will be as under:- 
 
(a) 
Approval of broad framework related to the proposed IGA along with AoN 
will be approved by the DAC. 
 
(b) 
Negotiations with the foreign Government agency/OEM will then be carried 
out by a Committee comprising of representatives of the Acquisition Wing, concerned 
SHQ, Defence (Finance) and the nominated domestic manufacturer, if any, to 
determine draft terms of the IGA to include estimated price, availability, 
indigenisation plan etc.  
 
(c) 
The MoD will then obtain the approval of the CCS on the draft IGA post 
which the IGA will be concluded with the foreign government. 
 
124. 
For other arrangements like FMS/SCOC, the case could be progressed with approval 
of AoN according authority. 
 
125. 
AMs/SHQ would be authorised to issue the RFP/LoR/Memorandum/LoI and sign the 
Contract/LoA, as applicable. The following cases would fall under the purview of this 
provision:- 
 
(a) 
When equipment of proven technology and capabilities belonging to a friendly 
foreign country is identified for procurement by our Armed Forces. 
 
(b) 
When very large value weapon system/platform, which was in service in a 
friendly foreign country, is available for transfer or sale (ex stock or fresh production).  
 

60 
 
(c) 
When specific equipment/platform, is under restriction for sale by the 
Government of the OEM’s country, such equipment may be obtained on lease for a 
specific period by signing an Inter-Governmental Agreement before a decision on its 
purchase is taken. 
 
126. 
In cases of large value acquisitions, especially cases requiring product support over a 
long period of time, it may be advisable to enter into a separate Inter Government Agreement 
(if not already covered under an umbrella agreement covering all cases) with the Government 
of the country from which the equipment is proposed to be procured after the requisite inter-
ministerial consultation. Such an Inter-Governmental Agreement is expected to safeguard the 
interests of the Government of India and should also provide for assistance of the foreign 
Government in case the contract(s) runs into unforeseen problems.  
 
127. 
Co-development. 
There may be cases where it is proposed to co-develop a 
product/equipment offering transformative/unique/niche technology; or a futuristic 
equipment/platform with a foreign country; or where co-development is likely to benefit 
ongoing indigenous projects in India. Such cases will be progressed under an IGA/specific 
Project Agreement after clearance from the AoN according authority based on the estimated 
cost of the project.  
 
128. 
Co-production. 
Similarly, there may be cases where it is proposed to work with 
a foreign entity to co-produce equipment/assemblies/sub-assemblies/spares for defence usage 
in India. Co-production opportunity may be progressed in any of the following cases with 
approval of the AoN according authority based on the ultimate estimated cost of the project:- 
 
(a) 
Import 
Substitution. 
Proprietary 
equipment 
or 
assemblies/sub-
assemblies/spares of equipment in service with Indian Armed Forces and where 
production in India would lead to reduction in Life Cycle Cost, besides contributing 
towards building a robust defence eco system. 
 
(b) 
The platform/equipment is of unique nature, not available or not being offered 
by other nations, and/or 
 
(c) 
Equipment where co-production of the platform/equipment will contribute 
towards making India a global/regional hub for manufacture/MRO/spares, and/or 
provide a boost to defence exports.  
 
(d) 
Where collaboration between Indian and foreign entity(ies) may lead to co-
development/co-production of products/components with potential for usage by 
Indian Armed Forces in future. 
 
Note.  In all such cases, SHQ would prima facie establish rationale for processing the 
case on a Single Vendor Basis; that is to examine that no other Nation can (e.g. 

61 
 
proprietary equipment) or is likely to offer higher IC prior to seeking AoN. The 
guiding principle in such cases shall be to maximise IC as well as ToT. 
 
Foreclosure of Cases 
 
129. 
Authority for Foreclosure of AoN.  
Cases where the AoN is required to be 
foreclosed due to change in operational philosophy, change in prioritisation for procurement 
or budgetary constraints will be approved by AoN according authority. Foreclosures for 
reasons 
other 
than the 
above 
may 
be 
approved 
by 
DG 
(Acquisition) 
and 
CISC/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DGICG for non-delegated and delegated powers cases 
respectively. In cases where RFPs have been issued, these would also be retracted. 
 
130. 
Authority for Retraction of RFP. Retraction of RFPs will be approved on file by 
the DG (Acquisition) and CISC/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DGICG for non-delegated and 
delegated powers cases respectively. Validity of the AoN would recommence from the date of 
retraction of RFP. 
 
Processing of Procurement Cases 
 
131. 
In order to cut down the delays in procurement of equipment and ensure that the 
procurement system is more responsive to the needs of the Armed Forces, the following steps 
need to be taken:- 
 
(a) 
Broad time frame for completion of different procurement activities, given at 
Appendix L should be adhered to. Major deviations from this time frame should be 
brought to the notice of the DPB, for necessary corrective measures.  
 
(b) 
Once the SoC is forwarded by SHQ to MoD for non-delegated cases, 
consolidated observations/ clarifications sought from and including the level of AM in 
the MoD and MoD (Finance) should be clarified in a discussion and minutes of the 
same recorded on file. For delegated power cases, the same will be ensured by 
respective PIFA/IFA(Capital) for observations related to financial effects.  
 
135. 
Monitoring Mechanism. 
To ensure that timelines of various stages are adhered to 
and the entire procurement schedule progresses in a time bound manner, regular 
feedback/update of all schemes will be conducted at SHQ/MoD levels as under:-

amendments required to remove difficulties arising due to typographical, referencing and 
syntax errors. Situations not foreseen and explained in the DAP may arise; under such 
circumstances the spirit as explained in preamble would provide the DAC the necessary 
guidance to determine the appropriate course of action.

keeping in view the overall need to ensure wider vendor participation. The specific 
criteria evolved by the SHQ for each case, as per these guidelines, may be got 
approved by the competent authority before including the same in the RFPs.  
 
5. 
Start Ups/ MSMEs. Start ups would be defined as per G.S.R. 127 (E) dated 19 Feb 
2019 (as amended from time to time). For procurement cases where the estimated cost is not 
exceeding ₹100 crores/ year based on delivery schedule at the time of seeking AoN or ₹ 150 
crores, whichever is higher, to encourage the Start Ups/ MSMEs and build Industrial 
ecosystem, the recognized Start Ups/ MSMEs in the relevant fields may be considered for 
issue of RFP without any stipulation of Financial parameters, except Paragraph 2(c)(iii) 
above (Insolvency) and with General and Technical parameters to be decided on case to case 
basis.

It is recommended that the SoC and RFP shall clearly bring out all the aspects of 
acquisition project like broad deliverables, proposed repair and maintenance philosophy, 
delivery schedule, broad scope of validation trials, time lines of procurement, Packaging & 
Preservation needed and financial aspects, etc.  
 
4. 
It is reiterated that these guidelines are indicative and do not limit the acquisition 
planner in visualising various additional scenarios that are likely to arise in individual cases.

Annexure I to Appendix C 
ESP, MRLS AND TRAINING 
 
Instructions to the Acquisition Planners 
 
1. 
Engineering Support Package (ESP) in terms of Field/ OB spares and B&D spares to 
be supplied along with the type of training required viz Operator training and Maintainer 
training are important to ensure correct and fault free operation as well as for undertaking 
first line, routine and breakdown maintenance.   
 
2. 
The spares required to be supplied along with the equipment or platform are, 
however, dependent upon the type of equipment/system/platform, intended usage, operation 
cycle and the maintenance support envisaged for the entire service life cycle of the 
equipment/system/platform. The maintenance support to be sought is also dependent upon the 

86 
 
complexity of the equipment, availability of the OEM for service support as well as the time 
required for delivery of the deficient spares.  Further, for equipment already inducted in 
service, it is imperative to seek spares based on experience gained in operation and 
maintenance to arrive at optimum spares requirement and to avoid wasteful expenditure.   
 
3. 
The above flowchart aims in aiding the analysis of an acquisition scheme for the 
above aspects. Acquisition planners are to follow following steps while formulating the 
RFP:- 
 
(a) 
Analyse in detail the equipment/system/platform required based on its usage, 
complexities in operations, criticality, likely OEM support for service and spare and 
past experience (if any) to arrive at the most optimum requirement of spares and 
training. Based on the envisaged maintenance support, the levels of training required 
by operators and maintainers are to be arrived at. 
 
(b) 
Various likely scenarios of relevant clauses in RFP and Standard Contract 
Document are as follows: -  
 
(i)  
Scenario 1. 
 Goods that are already in service and maintenance 
support is to be through comprehensive AMC (CMC).  Field level/ OB Spares 
in respect of these goods can be forecasted based on their exploitation pattern. 
 
(ii)  
Scenario 2. 
Goods that are already in service and maintenance 
support is to be through comprehensive MAC (CMC) but there is no 
requirement of stocking any Field level/ OB Spares based on past experience 
in exploitation and maintenance.  
 
(iii) 
Scenario 3. 
Goods that are already in service but needs to be 
repaired and maintained by Services/ICG crew and technicians. Field level/ 
OB Spares and B&D Spares in respect of these goods can be forecasted based 
the past experience on the same equipment and on their exploitation pattern. 
However, depending upon its place of operation and maintenance, it needs 
additional training as well as SMT/STE for the same.  
 
(iv)  
Scenario 4. 
 Goods already in service but needs to be repaired and 
maintained by Services/ICG crew and technicians. Field level/ OB Spares and 
B&D Spares in respect of these goods can be forecasted based on their 
exploitation pattern, however, there is no requirement of additional training. 
 
(v)  
Scenario 5. 
 Goods that are being inducted for the first time and 
based on its envisaged operation and maintenance philosophy needs to be 
repaired and maintained by Services/ICG crew and technicians. These goods 
would require MRLS from OEM, operation and maintenance training and may 
require Base Repair depot/ dockyard repair facility. 
 
(vi)  
Scenario 6. 
 Goods being inducted for the first time with 
maintenance support through CMC and only Field level/ OB Spares are to be 
provided by the OEM along with operation and maintenance training. 
 

87 
 
(vii)  
Scenario 7. 
Goods being inducted for the first time with 
maintenance support through CMC with no requirement of Field level/ OB 
Spares but OEM is to provide operation and maintenance training. 
 
(c) 
In case of requirement of User defined Field level/ OB Spares and B&D 
Spares, the list needs to be prepared and vetted by both user and maintenance 
directorate. 
 
(d) 
Terms of CMC need to unambiguously bring out the type of repairs/routines, 
allowable down time, level of spares support required as well as obsolescence 
management and upgrades requirement. 
 
(e) 
LD for CMC needs to be formulated and included in the commercial clauses. 
The various scenarios where LD may be imposed include exceeding downtime beyond 
contractual terms either in single case or overall down time in a given period, non-
stocking or non replenishment of spares, large number of defects leading to 
unreliability of equipment availability.

Annexure II to Appendix C 
 
SCOPE OF TRIALS, PRODUCTION STAGE QA AND 
ACCEPTANCE
 
Instructions to the Acquisition Planners 
 
1. 
The selection of right equipment largely depends the strength of criterion adapted for 
validation trials and post induction its intended reliable performance will depend on 
soundness of production stage QA & Acceptance trials. 

89 
 
 
2. 
The principle to be adopted during finalizing the validation trials and production 
stage QA & acceptance trials is that they should be sufficient and just. Any over 
specification will add to delays and cost whereas any under specification will result in sub 
standard equipment availability.   
 
3. 
Validation Trials. 
Validation trials are usually done on prototype set during 
design & development or equipment being inducted for first time in service. These are done 
only on one set i.e. first of type/prototype. If the same is not possible for reasons beyond 
control, a subsequent set may be used for validation. Where ab-initio design & development 
is involved then these are to be part of validation process of design. These are not necessary 
to be done for already in –service/ bulk orders/repeat orders or on all sets of the equipment 
unless specifically needed and included in SQRs/AoN. The validation trials may consist of 
User trials/FET, Technical & Environmental Evaluation, Maintainability Evaluation Trial, 
EMI/EMC Evaluation and Secrecy grading depending on the SQRs.  The above Flow Chart 
assists in arriving at necessary details. 
 
4. 
Production Stage QA & Acceptance. 
The requirements of Production stage 
QA & Acceptance trials are to be indicated in the RFP based on the type/origin of equipment, 
SQRs and categorisation. The complexity of manufacturing and end use of equipment are 
also to be kept in mind while specifying the QA requirements and Acceptance procedures 
respectively. The production stage QA may involve verification of internal QC reports and 
random surveillance/sampling for Raw Material, In-process, Assembly level, ESS for 
electronic components and FATs/HATs/SATs/OPs Checks. The flow chart enclosed gives the 
various scenarios and resultant formulations to aid in arriving at the requirements.    
 
5. 
It is therefore imperative that the validation trials, quality assurance and acceptance 
process is properly analysed and mandatory requirements incorporated in the RFP as many 
of these requirements may have significant performance, reliability, cost and time 
implications.  
 
6. 
The above flowchart aims in aiding the analysis of an acquisition scheme for the 
above aspects. Various likely scenarios of relevant clauses in RFP and Standard Contract 
Document are as follows: -  
 
(a)  
Scenario 1. 
 Goods that are already in service. They have been procured 
after validation trials and have been type certified. The type certification is valid. The 
manufacturing stage QAP and acceptance procedure is existing & approved. This will 
normally be in case of repeat orders. In such cases no Validation Trials/Type Testing 
is needed and one has to simply specify the correct references of the approved 
documents.  
 
(b)  
Scenario 2. 
 Goods that are already in service but are being procured with 
minor modifications. In such cases the requirement of repeating limited type tests and 
modification in QA & acceptance has to be ascertained and included in RFP. 
 
(c) 
Scenario 3. 
Goods that are being inducted for first time in service. In this 
case first it has to be ascertained whether they are Military grade/Ruggedised/COTs 
from the SQRs. In case of COTs, the scope of manufacturer’s certification/ CoC has 
to be finalised and included in RFP. Then the need for Acceptance tests is to be 

90 
 
established. If, acceptance tests are not required then only JRI/On Receipt Inspection 
for quantity has to be included in RFP.  
 
(d)  
Scenario 4. 
 Goods falling in Scenario 3 above but requiring Acceptance 
tests are part of this Scenario. In such cases the need and scope of Acceptance tests 
has to be specified in RFP.  
 
(e)  
Scenario 5. 
 Goods that are being inducted for first time in service and are 
required to be Ruggedised as per SQRs. The scope of Validation trials/Production 
stage QA & Acceptance will depend on the Categorisation of the equipment as per 
AoN. In cases categorised as Buy(Global), the equipment may be outrightly 
purchased or may contain India specific modifications. In outright purchase, the 
scope of Induction trials will be maximum (except Environmental tests which may be 
limited to the extent of Ruggedisation) and should cover all aspects and accordingly 
specified in RFP. However, the scope of production stage QA & Acceptance will 
depend on whether vendor is in India or abroad, manufacturing process, duration of 
delivery, order quantity and number of sub-vendors involved. The clarity on same can 
emerge only after vendor selection. Hence, the RFP has to be worded carefully to 
indicate requirement of evolving the same with mutual consent prior contract 
finalisation.    
 
(f)  
Scenario 6. 
 Goods falling in Scenario 5 but are Categorised Buy(I-IDDM) 
or Buy(Indian). Here, the scope of Validation trials will be maximum (except 
Environmental tests which may be limited to the extent of Ruggedisation) and should 
cover all aspects and accordingly specified in RFP. However, the scope of production 
stage QA & Acceptance will depend on complexity of equipment, maturity of 
manufacturing process for indigenous content, order quantity etc. The clarity on same 
can emerge only after vendor selection and level of indigenisation achieved. There 
may be a need to evolve and rationalise QA process with increasing indigenous 
content. Hence, the RFP has to be worded carefully to indicate requirement of 
evolving the same with mutual consent prior contract finalisation.      
 
(g) 
Scenario 7. 
Goods falling in Scenario 5 but are Categorised Buy & 
Make(Indian) or Buy& Make or Make. Here, the scope of Validation trials will be 
maximum (except Environmental tests which may be limited to the extent of 
Ruggedisation) and should cover all aspects and accordingly specified in RFP. 
However, the scope of production stage QA & Acceptance will get derived from the 
developer(in make case)/foreign partner’s processes, technology transfer, and Indian 
vendor/PA’s processes. The clarity on same can emerge only after vendor selection 
and level of technology absorption achieved in various stages. In make case the 
vendor will have to evolve QA along with developmental process. Hence, the RFP has 
to be worded carefully to indicate requirement of transferring QA as part of ToT / 
evolving the same with mutual consent prior contract finalisation. 
 
(h)  
Scenario 8. 
 Goods that are being inducted for first time in service and are 
required to be of Military grade as per SQRs. The scope of Validation 
trials/Production stage QA & Acceptance will depend on the Categorisation of the 
equipment as per AoN. In respective cases the Scenarios as applicable in Ruggedised 
equipment as above at Paragraph (e), (f) & (g) will be applicable except that in 
military grade equipment the full range of environmental tests will be undertaken.

PRESERVATION, PACKAGING, DELIVERY, ACCEPTANCE,  
PAYMENT TERMS AND WARRANTY(Contd…..) 
 
Instructions to the Acquisition Planners 
1. 
Goods delivered can be a standalone entity (system/ equipment) that can be 
independently exploited immediately on delivery or after storage for a certain period.  It can 
even be a sub-system/ assembly or a standalone entity that may require ’installation on’/ 
‘integration with’ another system for which the likely schedule of availability of premises for 
installation/ another system and readiness of such system for final acceptance is essential.  In 

93 
 
a few cases, even after completion of  installation/ integration of delivered goods,  final 
commissioning and acceptance of such system cannot be progressed being linked to the 
readiness of a larger system or other associated systems.  
2. 
Comprehensive understanding of all the above requirements and realistic assessment 
of likely availability of ‘other’ systems for trials and acceptance of the delivered goods is 
essential to optimally plan the acquisition, to retain the shelf-life of the goods even in the 
worst case scenario, so that the delivered goods are accepted in conformity with the planned 
acceptance scheme and its warranty commences with the exploitation for the intended 
purpose. 
3. 
These imperatives define the delivery schedule, packing, preservation (re-
preservation if any) & storage conditions, scheme and schedule for final acceptance, system 
readiness for final exploitation and commencement of warranty.  Payment terms for delivery 
of such goods need to be thoughtfully evolved to ensure that the payment is commensurate 
with the extent of fulfilment of contractual liability by the supplier.  Where the supplier had 
fulfilled contractual liability and ready to fulfil the next stage, but the next stage cannot be 
fulfilled due to unavailability of associated system/ platform not attributable to the supplier, 
suitable provision to make a part stage payment is to be made in the payment terms so that 
the payment is not delayed for reasons not attributable to the supplier.  
4. 
The above flowchart aims at aiding the analysis of the project for the above aspects. 
Acquisition planners are to follow the following steps while formulating the RFP:- 
(a) 
Analyse various stages of the project from the Delivery Schedule – Installation 
– Integration - Setting to Work - Commissioning - Final Acceptance as per the Flow 
Chart, to clearly understand the requirement, if any, of storage prior/ post 
installation, max duration for which the delivered goods are to be retained in 
preserved state (with due consideration to various risks that may delay their 
Installation-Integration-STW-Commissioning), analysis of likely delays in integration/ 
installation/ commissioning/ exploitation of the goods so as to arrive at an optimum 
plan and features to take care of all the possible scenarios in the RFP. 
 
(b) 
Various likely Scenarios of relevant clauses in the RFP and SCOCs are as 
follows:- 
 
(i)  
Scenario 1. 
 Equipment which are not required to be installed and 
integrated and also no STW/Acceptance trials are involved and are meant to be 
delivered to depots for stocking. These needs to be preserved for long duration 
but in a sheltered environment. The Warranty shall commence on completion of 
JRI. 
 
(ii)  
Scenario 1A.  Equipment which are not required to be installed and 
integrated and also no STW/Acceptance trials are involved and are meant to be 
delivered to end user directly for early usage. These need not be preserved for 
long duration. The Warranty shall commence post JRI/on receipt inspection. 
 
 (iii) 
Scenario 2. 
Equipment 
which 
is 
not 
required 
to 
be 
installed/integrated but needs to go through STW/Acceptance trials. In case 
there is not going to be much delay in STW/Acceptance trials after delivery then 

94 
 
the basic preservation for storing in Depots is needed, followed by de-
preservation by vendor. The warranty shall commence post Acceptance trials.  
 
(iv)  
Scenario 3. 
Equipment 
which 
is 
not 
required 
to 
be 
installed/integrated but needs to go through STW/Acceptance trials. In case 
there is going to be much delay in STW/Acceptance trials after delivery then the 
proper preservation for storing in Depots is needed, followed by de-
preservation/re-preservation by vendor may be needed and shall be included 
accordingly. The warranty shall commence post Acceptance trials.  
 
(v)  
Scenario 4. 
 Equipment which is required to be installed/integrated 
and needs to go through STW/Acceptance trials. In case there is going to be no 
delay 
in 
STW/Acceptance 
trials 
after 
delivery 
as 
associated 
systems/infrastructure is readily available then basic preservation and packing 
scheme should be worked out. The warranty shall commence post Acceptance 
trials. 
 
(vi)  
Scenario 4A.  Equipment which is required to be installed/integrated 
and needs to go through STW/Acceptance trials. In case there is going to be 
significant delay in STW/Acceptance trials after installation/integration due to 
operational/other  reasons then suitable in-situ preservation/de-preservation 
scheme should be worked out. The warranty shall commence post Acceptance 
trials. 
 
(vii)  
Scenario 5. 
 Equipment which is required to be installed/integrated 
and need to go through STW/Acceptance trials. In case there is going to be 
delay 
in 
installation/integration 
after 
delivery 
as 
associated 
systems/infrastructure is readily not available then suitable preservation and 
packing scheme should be worked out. There will be requirement to de-preserve 
the system by vendor, the same shall be included. The warranty shall commence 
post Acceptance trials. 
 
(viii) 
Scenario 6. 
Equipment which is required to be installed/integrated 
and need to go through STW/Acceptance trials. In case there is going to be 
significant delay in installation/integration trials after delivery as associated 
systems/infrastructure is not likely to be available in near future then robust 
preservation/de-preservation/re-preservation and packing scheme should be 
worked out. The equipment may be held in depots or may be at vendor premises. 
Suitable payment terms to the vendor have to be factored in. The warranty shall 
commence post Acceptance trials. 
(c) 
Packaging/ Preservation instructions and Delivery Schedule shall take above 
scenarios into consideration to ensure that the installation of goods and STW and Final 
Acceptance is completed before the expiry of preserved life.   
(d) 
Preservation & Packaging. The Preservation and Packaging plays a very 
important role in the equipment health prior installation and acceptance trials. Hence, 
the scheme of preservation and packaging must be carefully selected to meet the 
transportation and storage requirements prior fitment or delivery to depot. The kind of 

95 
 
preservation scheme to be used depends on the type of the equipment & it’s 
composition, Sub-systems and size (Electronic/ mechanical/hydraulic/composites), 
atmospheric conditions it will be stored in (whether the system is likely to be exposed to 
rain/sunlight/high temperature etc) and duration of storage. Depending on the 
preservation scheme and duration of storage there may be need for de-preservation and 
re-preservation. 
(e) 
Delivery Schedule. Realistic assessment of various timelines including likely 
delays in the availability of associated infra/ system/ platform for installation/ 
integration and STW, Commissioning & final acceptance is to be made and the delivery 
schedule is to evolved suitably to minimise avoidable storage of goods for extended 
periods.   
(f) 
Preservation Period. Based on the delivery schedule thus evolved, optimal 
preservation period is to be suitably arrived at and indicated in the RFP.   If necessary, 
inputs on the max feasible preservation period may be obtained from the OEMs during 
RFI process.  If the in-storage preservation period required is longer than the optimal/ 
max preservation period, requirement of in-storage de-preservation/ re-preservation is 
to be indicated in the RFP as a deliverable and contracted, with a condition that the 
payment will be made on actual utilisation as necessary. Similarly, if delay anticipated 
between installation/ integration and STW, Commissioning & Acceptance Trials, 
preservation during the period is to be included in the contract. 
(g) 
Warranty.  If the preserved state of the goods is ensured right through the   
storage and STW and commissioning, the warranty can commence with effective 
exploitation of the system, irrespective of delivery, so that the warranty can be gainfully 
utilised to test the equipment during exploitation.  If necessary, feedback from 
prospective bidders on this aspect can be gathered during RFI process. 
(h) 
Payment Terms.  If in spite of all efforts to logically evolve the delivery 
schedule, the goods are ready for delivery and corresponding infrastructure/ associated 
system/ platform is not available as expected for installation and integration in a 
reasonable time, the supplier cannot be denied payment for the work accomplished in 
conformity with the contract schedule.  The goods are to be accepted as per delivery 
schedule and the payment for the corresponding stage is to be made inline with the 
contract.  If the next stage of work cannot be executed by the supplier due to delay on 
the part of the buyer in providing requisite infra/ associated system/ platform for STW, 
Commissioning and Acceptance trials in a reasonable time, the payment terms should 
cater for making certain part of the associated stage payment (even before 
accomplishing requisite work), against submission of bank guarantee for equal amount 
and firm undertaking from the supplier that they will fulfil all the obligations 
immediately on availability of requisite infra/ associated system/ platform. For the 
purpose of defining payment terms, following guidelines may be followed:- 
(i) 
If Installation, Integration, STW, Commissioning and Acceptance trials 
of delivered goods does not involve establishing fructification of a new 
concept/ Development  project/ validating a proof of concept/ IDDM concept, 

96 
 
about 10 to 15% of total value of the goods is to be retained for installation, 
integration, STW, Commissioning and Acceptance.  
(ii) 
 If Installation, Integration, STW, Commissioning and Acceptance 
trials of delivered goods involves establishing fructification of a new concept/ 
Development  project/ validating a proof of concept/ IDDM concept, about 25 
to 30% of total value of the goods is to be retained for installation, 
integration, STW, Commissioning and Acceptance.

DEFENCE OFFSET GUIDELINES 
 
The provisions in the Defence Acquisition Procedure concerning offsets will be implemented 
as set out in succeeding paragraphs. 
 
1.  
Objective of Defence Offsets 
 
1.1  
The key objective of the Defence Offset Policy is to leverage the capital acquisitions 
and technology to develop Indian defence industry by (i) Fostering development of 
internationally competitive enterprises and (ii) Augmenting capacity for Research, Design 
and Development related to defence products. 
 
2. 
Quantum and Scope of Offsets 
 
2.1  
Applicability of Offsets. 
The Offsets clause would be applicable for Buy 
(Global) categories of procurement where the estimated AoN cost is ₹ 2000 crores or more. 
An Indian Vendor participating in the Buy (Global) category would be required to meet 
minimum 30% IC, failing which such vendor would be required to discharge offsets as 
applicable in the case. In certain cases, the DAC may consider partial or full waiver of the 
Offsets clause. In case of a waiver for a particular acquisition case, eligible/selected Indian 
vendors need not be exempted from the corresponding IC stipulations. No offsets will be 
applicable in all ab-initio Single Vendor Cases, including procurements based on IGA/FMS. 
 
2.1.1  For ‘Buy (Global)’ category procurements, if an Indian firm including a Joint Venture 
between an Indian Company and its foreign partner is bidding for the proposal, the clause 
relating to offset obligation will not be applicable if the IC in the product is more than 30 
percent. In case the IC in the product is less than 30 percent, the Indian firm or the Joint 
Venture has to ensure that offset obligations are fulfilled to the tune of ‘30% IC 
percentage’(IC is to be declared upfront at the time of submission of bid).In such a case, the 
Indian firm will clearly delineate the IC and offset portions in the offset contract and in offset 
claims. 
 
2.2  
30% of the estimated cost of the acquisition in ‘Buy (Global)’ category acquisitions 
will be the required value of the offset obligations.  
 
2.2.1 In respect of Shipbuilding cases on competitive basis (Section B, Chapter XII), for the 
purpose of calculating offset obligation, the total cost shall include basic cost of the vessel, 
cost of Base and Depot (B&D) spares and the modification cost. Offset obligations may be 
discharged with reference to eligible products and services as described in Annexure-VI to 
Appendix-E. 

109 
 
 
2.3  
The DAC may consider partial or full waiver of offset clause.  In case of a waiver for 
a particular acquisition case, eligible/selected Indian Vendors need to be exempted from the 
corresponding IC stipulation. 
 
2.4  
The offset condition will form a part of the RFP and subsequently of the main 
contract. A separate offset contract will be executed simultaneously with the main contract.  
 
2.5  
There will be no offset obligations in (i) Procurements under the Fast Track 
procedure, and (ii) Procurements under the ‘Option clause’ where an offset obligation was 
not stipulated in the original contract. In respect of procurements under the “Option clause’ 
where an offset obligation was stipulated in the original contract, the offset guidelines 
prevailing at the time of signing of the original contract would be applicable. 
 
3.  
Avenues for Discharge of Offset Obligations 
 
3.1  
In compliance to Paragraph 1 above, offset obligations may be discharged by any one 
or a combination of the following methods: 
 
(a)  
Direct purchase of, or executing export orders for, eligible products manufactured by, 
or services provided by Indian enterprises, i.e. DPSUs, OFB and private and public sector. 
The list of products and services eligible for discharge of offset obligations is at Annexure VI 
to Appendix-E.  
 
(b)  
Investment in defence manufacturing: This could be through FDI or direct investment 
or joint ventures or through the non-equity route for co-production, co-development and 
production or licensed production of defence products. Such investment would be subject to 
the guidelines/licensing requirements stipulated by the Department for Promotion of Industry 
and Internal Trade (DPIIT)/ Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Government of India. The list 
of `eligible products’ for discharge of offset obligations is at Annexure VI to Appendix-E.  
 
(c)  
Investment in ToT to Indian enterprises for manufacture of eligible products. The list 
of eligible products for discharge of offset obligations is at Annexure VI to Appendix-E. The 
investment in terms of ToT must cover all documentation, training and consultancy required 
for full ToT (civil infrastructure and related equipment is excluded). The ToT should be 
provided without licence fee and there should be no restriction on domestic production, sale 
or export. 
 
(d)  
Acquisition of technology through ToT to Government institutions and establishments 
engaged in the manufacture and/or maintenance of eligible products as listed at Annexure VII 
to Appendix-E, including DRDO and OFB/DPSUs. This will include augmenting capacity 
for Research, Design and Development, Training and Education but exclude civil 
infrastructure and related equipment. 
 

110 
 
(e)  
Technology Acquisition by the DRDO in areas of critical technology as listed in 
Annexure-VIII to Appendix-E. Guidelines for this purpose are at Annexure-IX to      
Appendix-E.  
 
Note:  
(i) 
Where ToT is proposed under Paragraph 3.1(c) and 3.1(d) above, Vendor shall ensure 
that the ToT is comprehensive and all aspects of design, manufacturing know-how and know-
why is made available to the IOP. 
 
4.  
Indian Offset Partner (IOP) 
 
4.1  
Indian enterprises, institutions and establishments engaged in the manufacture of 
eligible products and/or provision of eligible services, including DRDO, are referred to as the 
Indian Offset partner (IOP). 
 
4.2  
The IOP shall, besides any other regulations in force, also comply with the 
guidelines/licensing requirements stipulated by the DPIIT/MHA as applicable. 
 
4.3  
The Vendor/Tier-I sub-vendor will be free to select the IOP for implementing the 
offset obligation provided the IOP has not been barred from doing business by the Ministry 
of Defence. 
 
4.4  
In relation to the discharge of offset obligation, the agreement between the 
Vendor/Tier-1sub-vendor and the IOP shall be subject to the laws of India. 
 
5.  
Discharge of Offset Obligations 
 
Vendor Responsibility 
 
5.1  
The vendor of the main procurement contract will be responsible for the fulfillment of 
offset obligations. The vendor may allow his Tier-1 sub-vendors under the main procurement 
contract to discharge offset obligations, to the extent of their work share (by value), on behalf 
of the vendor. However, overall responsibility and liability for the full discharge of offset 
obligations shall continue to remain with the vendor. Any shortfall by the Tier-1 sub-vendor 
shall be made good by the vendor, failing which the vendor shall be liable for penalty and 
debarment as stipulated in the offset guidelines. 
 
5.1.1 In respect of Paragraph 3.1(b), 3.1(d) and 3.1(e) offset discharge can be permitted by 
entities other than vendor/Tier-1 Sub-vendor on a case to case basis.  
 
 
Period for Discharge 
 

111 
 
5.2 
 Offset obligations are to be discharged within a time frame that can extend beyond 
the period of the main procurement contract by a maximum period of two years. The period 
of main contract includes the period of warranty of the equipment being procured under the 
main contract. 
 
Performance Bond 
 
5.3 
Where the period for discharge of offset obligations exceeds the period of the main 
procurement contract, the vendor will be required to furnish an additional Performance Bond 
to Defence Offset Management Wing (DOMW) in the form of a Bank Guarantee covering 
the full value of the un-discharged offset obligations falling beyond the period of the main 
procurement contract. This Performance Bond shall be reduced annually, until full extinction, 
based on the pro rata value of the discharged offset obligation accepted by DOMW. The 
additional Performance Bond shall be submitted six months prior to expiry of the main 
Performance-cum-Warranty Bond. 
 
Offset Credits for Investment in Defence Manufacturing  
 
5.4 
Where the discharge of offset obligation is proposed in terms of Paragraph 3.1(b), L1 
vendor must provide a Detailed Project Report (DPR) with cost break-up. Offset discharge 
shall be subject to physical completion of the project and verification of audited accounts of 
the company setting up the manufacturing unit. 
Offset Credits for Investment in ToT 
 
5.5 
Where technology is proposed to be transferred under Paragraph 3.1(c), a third party 
valuation from the recognized/certified valuation firms duly accepted by the IOP to be 
submitted. The valuation so determined should be supported and justified through following 
approaches: 
Cost Approach 
(i) 
Current cost estimate of technology development effort. 
(ii)  
Cost saving due to local purchase vs Global purchase. 
(iii)  
Net present value of the expected proceeds from future sales. 
Market Approach: 
(i)  
Revenues generated from the technology till date. 
(ii)  
Exclusive use or territorial protection. 
(iii)  
Creation of new market for IOP. 
(iv)  
Jobs creation (Direct & Indirect). 
 
Note:   Cost of the valuation will be borne by the vendor and no offset credits will be 
admissible for the cost of valuation. It would be appropriate if the same is transferred by the 

112 
 
vendor to the government and it then hires the valuer jointly with the vendor. Another option 
is for the valuer to be hired by the vendor in consultation with the Government.  Detailed 
procedure for valuation of technology being transferred to Indian Industry, including the list 
of approved valuers, will be issued separately by DDP. 
Value Addition 
 
5.6 
The concept of value addition will apply only for direct purchase/export of eligible 
products. Value Addition will be determined by subtracting (i) value of imported components 
(i.e.) import content in the product and (ii) any fees/royalty paid. 
 
Note: IC aspects are as given at Paragraph 8-12 and Appendix B to Chapter I 
 
Multiplier  
 
5.7 
In the discharge of Offset obligation under 3.1 (a), the following multiplier will be 
permitted: 
 
(a) 
Eligible products - Multiplier of 1.0 
 
(b) 
Components of eligible products - Multiplier of 0.5 
 
Provided, where Indian Offset Partner (IOP) is a Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise 
(MSME) and discharge of offset obligation is proposed under Paragraph 3.1(a), a multiplier 
of 1.5 will be permitted. MSMEs are as defined by Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium 
Enterprises, Government of India from time to time. 
 
5.8 
In the discharge of Offset obligation under 3.1 (b), a multiplier of 1.5 will be 
permitted. 
 
Provided where the investment is under Paragraph 3.1(b) in Defence Industrial Corridors 
notified by the Department of Defence Production, a multiplier of 2 will be permitted. 
 
5.9 
In the discharge of Offset obligation under 3.1(c), a multiplier of 2 will be permitted. 
 
5.10 
In the discharge of Offset obligation under 3.1(d), a multiplier of 3 will be permitted 
 
5.11 
In the discharge of offset obligations under Paragraph 3.1(e), relating to critical 
technology acquisition by DRDO, a multiplier of 4 will be permitted.  
 
Note: Clubbing of multipliers is not permitted. 
 
 
 
Valuation of Offsets 
 

113 
 
5.12 
All investments made after signing of the main procurement contract shall only be 
reckoned for discharge offset obligations. For the purpose of these offset guidelines, the date 
of discharge of offset obligations under Paragraph 3.1 shall be the date of completion of the 
transaction, based on documentary evidence as the date of discharge of offset obligation. The 
value of the offset components for which offset credits are sought would have to be supported 
by documentary evidence.  
 
5.13 
Only contracts for direct purchase or export of eligible products or investments made 
in eligible products after signing of the main procurement contract shall be reckoned for 
discharging offset obligations. For the purpose of these offset guidelines, the date of 
discharge of offset obligations under Paragraph 3.1 (a) shall be reckoned as the date of 
invoice or the date of final payment whichever is later. In case of equity investment under 
Paragraph 3.1 (b) or other investments or ToT and Technology Acquisition covered under 
paras 3.1 (c), (d), and (e), the date of completion of the transaction, based on documentary 
evidence shall be reckoned as the date of discharge of offset obligation. The value of the 
offset components for which offset credits are sought would have to be supported by 
documentary evidence. Only transactions undertaken after signing of the offset contract will 
be reckoned for discharging offset obligations.

implementation of the Offset guidelines. 
 
7.  
Submission of Offset Proposals 
 
7.1 
Paragraph 45 of Chapter II read with Schedule I of DAP 2020 prescribes the standard 
RFP document. Paragraph 10 of the RFP format will apply when offsets are attracted. At the 
stage of submission of the techno-commercial proposal, the vendor will submit a written 
undertaking in the format at Annexure I to Appendix-E to the effect that he will meet the 
offset obligations laid down in the RFP as per the Defence Offset Guidelines. This 
undertaking will be included in the envelope containing the vendors’ technical bid. It will be 
binding on the vendor and will clearly state that failure on the part of the vendor to comply 
with the offset guidelines at any stage may result in disqualification of the vendor from any 
further participation in the tender/contract. It may also result in imposition of penalties 
indicated in Paragraph 8.11 and render the vendor liable for debarment from participating in 
future procurement contracts for a period up to five years as indicated in Paragraph 8.15. 
Failure to submit the undertaking in Annexure-I to Appendix-E shall render the bid non 
responsive and liable to be rejected. 
 
7.2  
The Technical and Commercial offset proposals have to be submitted by the vendor 
by a date to be specified in the RFP, which would normally be 12 weeks from the date of 
submission of the main technical and commercial proposals. Exact date as calculated and 
given in the RFP or intimated later by the ADG Acquisition Technical will be binding. The 
technical and commercial offset proposal should be submitted in two separate sealed cover to 
the ADG Acquisition Technical of Acquisition Wing. The Technical Offset proposals and the 
Commercial Offset proposal should be submitted as per formats at Annexure II and 
Annexure III to Appendix ‘E’ respectively. The commercial offset proposal must provide 
details of the business model for proposals relating to Paras 3.1(c) of the offset guidelines in 
case offset credits are being sought under these specific provisions. The Technical and 
Commercial Offset proposal for Technology Acquisition by DRDO under Paragraph 3.1(e) of 
the Offset Guidelines will be forwarded by the ADG Acquisition Technical to DRDO. In case 
any offset credits are claimed under Paragraph 3.1(e) of the Offset Guidelines, the Technical 

115 
 
and commercial proposal should be submitted in a separate envelope as per format at 
Annexure-IX to Appendix ‘E’. Failure to submit offset proposals within the stipulated time 
frame shall render the bid non-responsive and liable to be rejected. The technical and 
commercial offset proposals will be forwarded by the ADG Acquisition Technical to the 
concerned SHQs and Acquisition Managers respectively. 
 
8.  
Processing of Offset Proposals 
 
Technical Evaluation 
 
8.1 
The Technical Offset Evaluation Committee (TOEC) will be constituted by the ADG 
Acquisition Technical with approval of the DG (Acquisition). The TOEC will include 
representatives of the SHQ, Defence (Fin), DRDO and DOMW. The Committee may also 
include experts, as may be deemed necessary, with approval of the DG (Acquisition). The 
TOEC will be chaired by JS (DOMW). The Member Secretary shall be nominated by the 
SHQs. The TOEC Report will be forwarded to DG(Acq) through ADG Acquisition Technical 
for acceptance.  
 
8.2 
The TOEC will scrutinize the technical offset proposals (excluding proposals for 
Technology Acquisition by DRDO as per Paragraph 8.3) to ensure conformity with the offset 
guidelines. For this purpose, the vendor may be advised to undertake changes to bring his 
offset proposals in conformity with the offset guidelines. During TOEC, the vendor is 
expected to provide details pertaining to IOP wise work share, specific products and 
supporting documents indicating eligibility of IOPs in addition to conformity with other 
clauses in the offset guidelines. If the vendor is unable to provide these details at the time of 
the TOEC, the same may be provided to DOMW either up to one year prior to discharge of 
offset obligations through that IOP or at the time of seeking offset credits. 
 
(a) 
If the vendor submits the required documents up to one year prior to discharge 
 
of offset obligations through a particular IOP, the final decision regarding 
 
admissibility of proposal shall be intimated by DOMW within three months of receipt 
 
of complete documents.  
 
 
(b) 
If the vendor submits the required documents at the time of seeking offset 
 
credits, DOMW will establish eligibility of IOP, product and offset discharge avenue 
 
along with other compliance issues and if found ineligible on any count, penalty will 
 
be imposed by treating the transactions as invalid. If the proposal is found ineligible 
 
the vendor incurs the risk of re-phasing with consequent enhancement of 5% in 
 
obligations, in case, the annual commitments change due to such ineligibility. 
 
The TOEC will be expected to submit its report within 4-8 weeks of its constitution. 
 
Note: 

116 
 
(i) 
The vendors are free to select option under Paragraph 8.2.Once approved; no 
change in option shall be permitted during the contract period. 
 
(ii) 
 In case ToT is proposed under Paragraph 3.1(c) and 3.1(d), the vendor will be 
 
required to provide details of ToT at the time of TOEC. 
Technology Acquisition 
 
8.3 
Offset Proposals relating to Paragraph 3.1(e) will be assessed by a Technology 
Acquisition Committee (TAC) to be constituted by the DRDO with the approval of Scientific 
Advisor to Raksha Mantri. The assessments will cover both technical as well as financial 
parameters, including valuation of technology, and also indicate the time frame and strategy 
for utilizing the technology. The TAC will send its recommendations, duly approved by SA 
to RM, to the ADG Acquisition Technical within a period of 4-8 weeks of its constitution, for 
incorporation in the TOEC Report. Guidelines for processing Technology Acquisition 
proposals are at Annexure-IX to Appendix-E. 
 
Commercial Evaluation 
 
8.4 
The Commercial Offset Offer will contain the detailed offer specifying the value of 
the total offset commitment components, with a yearly breakdown of the details, phasing, 
IOPs. The commercial offset offer will be opened along with the main commercial offer after 
the TOEC report has been accepted by the DG (Acquisition). The commercial offset offer 
will have no bearing on determination of the L-1 Vendor. 
 
8.5 
The CNC for the main procurement case will verify that the Commercial Offset Offer 
meets the stipulated offset obligations. Only the commercial offset offer of the L-1 vendor in 
the main procurement proposal will be evaluated by the CNC. The L-1 vendor may amend 
the commercial offset offer at this stage, to align the proposal with the technical offset 
proposal, if required. For evaluation of the commercial offset proposals, the CNC will include 
a representative of DOMW as member. The commercial valuation of Technology Acquisition 
by TAC (refer Paragraph 8.3) will be incorporated in the CNC Report. 
 
Approval Authority 
 
8.6 
The draft negotiated Offset Contract (Annexed with the CNC report), will be 
processed by the Acquisition Manager and approved by Raksha Mantri, regardless of their 
value. Offset proposals will also be incorporated in the note seeking approval of Competent 
Financial Authority (CFA) for the main procurement proposal for information of the CFA. 
The offset contract will be signed by the Acquisition Manager along with the main 
procurement contract. Signed copies of the offset contract will be made available to DOMW 
for its implementation. 
 
Model Offset Contract 

117 
 
 
8.7 
A model Offset Contract is at Annexure-IV to Appendix-E. The provisions of Offset 
Guidelines as applicable will be appropriately reflected in the Offset Contract in a particular 
case. Any deviation from the guidelines in a particular case will be put up to DAC through 
DPB for approval. The offset contract shall be subject to the laws of India. 
 
Submission of Offset Discharge Claims 
 
8.8  
The vendor shall submit offset discharge claims in the format in Annexure-V to 
Appendix E to the DOMW through the online portal. DOMW may conduct an audit by a 
nominated officer or agency to verify the actual status of implementation. 
 
Discharge of Offset Obligations 
 
8.9 
On approval of offset claims by the competent authority from time to time, DOMW 
shall convey discharge of offsets to the vendors. 
 
Yearly Offset Obligations  
 
8.10 
A vendor shall be required to fulfill offset obligations in accordance with the annual 
phasing plan as agreed in the offset contract. 
 
Penalties 
 
8.11 
If a vendor fails to fulfill the offset obligation in a particular year in accordance with 
the annual phasing as agreed in the offset contract, a penalty equivalent to five percent of the 
unfulfilled offset obligation will be levied on the vendor. The unfulfilled offset value will re-
phased as per Paragraph 8.14. The penalty may either be paid by the vendor or recovered 
from the bank guarantee of the main procurement contract or deducted from the amount 
payable under the main procurement contract or recovered from the Performance Bond of the 
offset contract. The overall cap on penalty will be 20 percent of the total offset obligation 
during the period of the main procurement contract. There will be no cap on penalty for 
failure to implement offset obligations during the period beyond the main procurement 
contract. The penalties will be administered by DOMW in consultation with Acquisition 
Wing, as required. 
 
Re-phasing of offset obligations 
 
8.12 
A vendor may, by giving reasons, request re-phasing of the offset obligations within 
the period of the offset contract. The re-phasing request of the vendor will be processed 
without any disincentives if the shortfall is re-phased to the following year. However, if the 
re-phasing of offset value is proposed over the subsequent years, then 5% additional 
obligation will be imposed on re-phased value of every year. The re-phasing request for 
second and subsequent attempts will be processed by imposing additional 5% on proposed 

118 
 
yearly re-phased offset value irrespective of the spread of re-phasing. This yearly additional 
5% offset obligation for processing re-phasing request will be over and above the outright 
financial penalty on shortfall specified at Paragraph 8.11 of Defence Offset Guidelines. JS 
(DOMW) may allow the request, with the approval of Secretary, Defence Production. Re-
phasing will not be permitted beyond the period stipulated in Paragraph 5.2 of the guidelines.  
 
Change in IOP or Offset Avenue 
 
8.13 
DOMW may recommend change in offset partner or offset avenue on being 
convinced that the change is necessary to enable the vendor to fulfill offset obligations. The 
vendor will be required to submit such request through DOMW online portal and which shall 
be disposed of within 03 months. Any change in IOP/offset avenue of a Tier-1 sub-vendor 
will have to be forwarded to DOMW through the vendor. The overall value of offset 
obligations shall, however, remain unchanged. Any change in the IOP and Offset Avenue 
shall be approved by the Secretary, Defence Production.  
Offset Contract Amendment 
8.14 
Any amendments to the offset contract due to changes in paras 8.12 and 8.13 shall be 
incorporated by the JS (DOMW) in the offset contract through a Supplementary Contract. 
JS(DOMW) shall intimate such changes to the concerned Acquisition Manager immediately 
after they have been approved.

experts from the concerned laboratories, other national S&T laboratories, Service 
Headquarters, HQ IDS, members from academia and research institutions, Additional 
Financial Adviser (DRDO), and other organizations as deemed necessary, specific to each 
proposal received. TAC could seek the services of professional bodies for valuation of 
technology, if required. 
 
5. 
TAC will process cases acceptable as valid offset proposals after initial screening. If 
the TAC in its assessment feels that the technology so indicated is already available and/or is 
of no further use by the DRDO, it may reject the proposal and intimate the ADG Acquisition 
Technical. Recommendations of TAC will be incorporated in the TOEC report under 
Paragraph 8.1 of the Offset Guidelines. 
 
6. 
The TAC may call for a presentation and detailed technical discussions with the 
OEM/Vendor to understand various aspects of the proposal. Where necessary, the TAC may 
visit the Vendors’ premises to make an assessment of the technology offered. 
 
7. 
TAC will make its recommendations based on viability of the proposal, the 
technology implications, options for availability of the technology, range and depth of 
acquisition indicated, absorption capability in the country, status of IP before, on and after 
acquisition and a fair assessment of the cost of technology. The TAC will recommend a

Appendix F of Chapter II 
(Refers to Paragraph 51 of 
Chapter II) 
 
PRODUCT SUPPORT 
 
1. 
Product Support is a mechanism to ensure maintainability, performance and reliability 
throughout the operational life of the equipment, thereby ensuring ‘Capability Sustenance’ 
along with ‘Capability Acquisition’. The structure of the Life Cycle Support package is to be 
aligned with the envisaged Repair and Maintenance Philosophy which inter-alia would 
include supply of spares, special tools, repairs of defective equipment / modules / LRUs, 
services of specialists and creation of maintenance eco-system, etc. 
 
2. 
Maintenance Philosophy. 
Maintenance of the equipment is structured on three 
different levels.  The Maintenance philosophy can be categorised into ‘O’, ‘I’ & ‘D’ levels 
depending upon the technological complexity of the equipment as under :- 
 
(a) 
‘O’ Level.   Includes Unit and Field Repairs (1st& 2nd Level). 
 
(i) 
Unit Repairs. Repairs, carried out within the unit holding the 
equipment using tools supplied by the manufacturer as per scaling. These 
repairs generally pertain to cleaning, lubrications, minor repairs and 
replacement of components and minor assemblies including Line Replaceable 
Units (LRUs) etc, carried out without any sophisticated tools or test 
equipment. The manufacturer is required to provide the following as per 
provisions in the RFP for carrying out such repairs :- 
 
(aa) 
Table of Tools and Equipment (TOTE) including operators 
manual.  
 
(ab) 
Scaling of Special Maintenance Tools (SMT), Special Test 
Equipment (STE) and Special Equipment (SE). 
 
(ii) 
Field Repairs. Repairs carried out at field/flotilla/station level or 
equivalent service organisation by technicians specially trained for the 
purpose, requiring special tools and spares provided additionally for the class 
of the equipment. These repairs comprise replacement of common Line 
Replaceable Units (LRUs), sub-modules, other components beyond the 
holding of units and repairs undertaken beyond a unit level. Normally, a 
field/station workshop covers such repairs of a group of units holding the said 
class of equipment and their number will be stated based on equipment 
deployment pattern. The manufacturer in addition to the basic unit level 
SMTs/STEs/SE, is required to provide the following:- 
 

134 
 
(aa) 
Quantity and specification of spares up to sub-module level, 
other replaceable components that need to be stocked for a specified 
population and class of the equipment. 
 
(ab) 
Additional Special Maintenance Tools and Test Equipment 
needed for each such field/flotilla/station work shop. 
 
(b) 
‘I’ Level. Includes 3rd level Intermediate Repairs by Corps Zone 
workshop/Dockyard/Base Repair Depot or other similar service organisation. These 
are extensive or special repairs carried out to include component level repairs. This 
level of repair envisages special diagnosis and repairs of the repairable inventory up 
to Printed Circuit Board (PCB) level, major assemblies, interface equipment/software 
and other components beyond the scope of field/flotilla/station level repairs. These 
repairs are carried out in the designated workshops by technicians specially trained for 
this purpose requiring special tools and spares and the number of such facilities will 
be stated based on equipment deployment pattern. The manufacturer is required, 
among others, to provide the following:- 
 
(i) 
Quantity and specification of spares up to PCB level that need to be 
stocked for a population of the equipment. 
 
(ii) 
Special Maintenance Tools and Test Equipment that has to be provided 
to each of these workshops. 
 
(iii) 
Oils and lubricants necessary for Servicing. 
 
(iv) 
All necessary technical literature. 
 
(v) 
Calibration facilities for test equipment, where applicable.  
 
(c) 
‘D’ Level.   These repairs include 4th level extensive Base Overhauls (BOH)/ 
Depot level Repairs which are either routine and planned or necessitated due to major 
repairs/renewal requirements requiring stripping and rebuilding of equipment. 
Extensive repairs of components / sub-assemblies and overhaul of the complete 
equipment is carried out by this facility and due to the complexity requires specific 
technical knowledge, infrastructure, related documentation, experience and proper 
quality control. Post such repairs, detailed trials are conducted usually by the 
overhauling agency, prior to handing over of the equipment to the unit for operational 
exploitation. Depending on the population of the equipment, such facilities may be 
established in the country. For this, the manufacturer is required to provide the 
following:- 
 
(i) 
All Special Maintenance Tools, jigs, fixtures and test equipment for 
carrying out repairs up to component / PCBs/ module level. 

135 
 
(ii) 
Oils and lubricants necessary for overhaul. 
 
(iii) 
All necessary technical literature. 
 
(iv) 
Calibration facilities for test equipment.

a period as specified in the contract, on receipt of notification from the Buyer 
for the Life-Cycle Support period. The Seller will confirm that, if two different 
prices have been given for the same/similar item, then the lower price quoted 
will prevail. In case, the quoted accessories has several items viz, Sampling 
Accessory Kit and add up price of these items is higher than the quoted price 
of the accessory, then the price would be lowered / adjusted proportionately 
for the items.   
 
(ii) 
‘Buy Back’ Clause. The Buyer would have the option to amend the 
Manufacturer’s Recommended List of Spares (MRLS) proposed by the Seller 
within a period specified in the contract, post expiry of the warranty period. 
The Seller needs to agree to either ‘Buy Back’ the spares rendered surplus or 
exchange them on ‘cost-to-cost’ basis with the spares, as required by the 
Buyer.  The said spares would be purchased / replaced by the Seller, based on 
the prices negotiated in the contract. 
 
Note. Vendors quoting lesser ESP / MRLS in terms of range and depth will be 
governed by the Adequacy Clause. The vendors quoting surplus items in ESP / MRLS 
would have to buy back the surplus spares as per the Buy Back Clause. 
 
(b) 
User Defined List of Spares (UDLS). 
Cases where the equipment is 
already in use with the Service, the initial lot of spares will be procured based on the 
UDLS, as recommended by the Maintenance Agency instead of the MRLS.

Trials have different connotations depending on category of acquisition and have 
varied scope as well as stakeholders defined by the type of trial. The agency planning and 
ordering the trial will promulgate comprehensive instructions to include, inter alia, defined 
scope, methodology of conduct, outcomes expected, acceptance criteria and follow-on 
actions.  Important types of trials and their broad scope is enumerated in the succeeding 
paragraphs. 
 
2. 
Field Evaluation Trial (FET). 
Details of these are as elaborated at Paragraphs 
65 to 83 in Chapter II. 
 
 
3. 
Induction Trials/ Validation Trials.     Induction/ Validation trials are usually done 
when the design and development trials were conducted on prototype set and the equipment 
is productionised for first time. These are done on the First Off Production Model (FoPM) 
equipment to validate specified parameters and to rule out any inconsistency in the 
production process. Bulk Production Clearance (BPC) is invariably accorded once the FoPM 
equipment clears the Validation/Induction Trials. Validation trials may also be carried out on 
major change owing to upgrades of specified parameters or change of production line from 
OEM premises to Indian Production Agencies premises. 
 
4. 
Factory Acceptance Trials (FATs).     These are functional tests which may be 
undertaken at vendor’s premises by Services nominated team to check the equipment 
functional performance as per an approved test procedure prior dispatch.  
 
5. 
Installation Inspection (IIs). 
These are checks done by Services nominated 
team to check correct installation of equipment. 
6. 
Harbour Acceptance Trials (HATs). 
These are functional tests which may be 
undertaken after installation on-board ship in harbour by a Services nominated trial team to 
check the equipment functional performance as per an approved test procedure.  
 
7. 
Sea Acceptance Trials (SATs). 
These are functional tests, including proof firing 
in case of weapons, which may be undertaken at sea after installation on-board ship by 
Services nominated team to check equipment’s functional performance as per an approved 
test procedure.  
 
8. 
Op Checks. 
     These are functional tests which may be undertaken after 
installation on-board ship at sea by a SHQ nominated team to check the equipment’s 

147 
 
functional performance as per an approved test procedure.  These are normally done only on 
communication equipment, instead of SATs. 
 
9. 
Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP).  
A functional test procedure undertaken 
to check functional performance of the system for acceptance at a defined stage. It may also 
involve proof firing in case of weapons. For details also refer to Paragraph 46 of Chapter II. 
 
10. 
Delivery Acceptance Trials.   Delivery Acceptance Trials are carried out when FET 
is not applicable for cases such as ships, submarines, simulators etc, where there is no 
prototype available for conduct of NCNC trials.   
 
11. 
Pre-Despatch Inspection (PDI). 
Pre-Despatch Inspection is a part of supply 
chain management and an important Quality Assurance method for checking the quality and 
quantity of newly manufactured goods at Sellers’ Premises, before they are shipped to the 
Buyer. These involve undertaking checks in accordance with Acceptance Test Procedures as 
finalised during contract negotiations. PDI helps in ensuring that production complies with 
the governing specifications and procedures as specified in the Contract or Purchase Order. 
 
12. 
Joint Receipt Inspection (JRI). 
Joint Receipt Inspection, initiated by the Buyer, 
is carried out jointly by the buyer and seller on arrival of manufactured goods in India within 
specified number of days and at location nominated by the Buyer to check compliance with 
specifications. JRI consists of quantitative checking of delivered items, check proof, firing 
etc, as per governing specifications and procedures enumerated in the Contract or Purchase 
Order. 
 
Stage Wise Inputs for Trials 
 
13. 
RFI Stage. 
The following inputs should be obtained via the RFI or through vendor 
interaction:- 
 
 
(a) 
Inputs on test standards adopted for equipment of similar type. 
 
(b) 
Ascertain parameters for which Certification applicable in lieu of trial 
evaluation. 
 
(c) 
Trials for which simulation / modelling is available.  
 
(d) 
Specialised requirements for trial evaluation to be factored while drafting 
SQRs. 
 
14. 
SQR Stage. 
To achieve an objective trial methodology, SHQ should interact with 
all trial agencies prior to finalisation of SQRs to ensure the following: - 
 
(a) 
Identification and application of correct standards. 

148 
 
 
(b) 
Environmental and material tests essential for operational deployment and 
role. 
 
(c) 
Applicability of EMI / EMC trials especially for non-ICT or other equipment 
not operating in dense EM environment. EMI/EMC trials shall be included only if 
operational requirements in SQR so determine and should be specifically mentioned 
in such cases. 
 
(d) 
SQR parameters that affect sustenance and MET related aspects and will need 
to be factored in trial methodology.   
 
15. 
Trial Methodology at RFP Stage.  
The combination of SQR and Trial 
Methodology in the RFP should provide OEM / Vendor a clear and objective assessment of 
the scope and details of FET, including areas where certification and trials by simulation are 
allowed. SHQ may interact with vendors/industry and reps of trial agencies at the draft RFP 
stage. Maximum technical details available at this stage with regard to conduct of FET, 
Technical trials (including environmental tests), MET and EMI / EMC tests should be 
included in the Trial Methodology being issued with RFP. Due care may be exercised while 
defining Standards that would apply to equipment, systems or platforms.  In case 
international standards are envisaged, then their Indian equivalent, where applicable, should 
also be identified.  As far as possible, availability of test and certification facilities within 
India to evaluate the parameters governed by shortlisted Standards should be considered.  In 
case this is not feasible, then all efforts should be made to identify international 
certification/accreditation agencies that would qualify the evaluation requirements.  The 
following inputs should also be obtained along with those on the FET in Chapter II:- 
 
(a) 
QA agencies, EMI/EMC and Maintenance organisations should forward the 
following to SHQ for formulation of  trial methodology: - 
 
(i) 
Recommendation on qualification Standards to be adopted. 
 
(ii) 
Details of technical trials including environmental conditions for the 
lab tests and also check proof of weapons and ammunition. 
 
(iii) 
Parameters where trials can be replaced by certification along with list 
of accredited labs/ facilities within or outside their organisations where these 
trials can be conducted. 
 
(b) 
Where Certificate of Conformance (CoC) is acceptable in place of trials, trial 
agencies shall forward the following details to SHQ to be included in the RFP: - 
 
(i) 
List of agency/authority(ies) whose certification will be allowed. 
 

149 
 
(ii) 
Details and format of test certificates and supporting documents 
required to be submitted by the OEM/ vendor to prove the validity of CoC.

Chapter II) 
 
GUIDELINES TO BE FOLLOWED WHEN CHANGE OF NAME OF VENDOR IS 
INVOLVED WHILE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS 
 
 
1. 
Whenever, the vendor participating in the defence procurement process, initiates the 
process for change of name with corporate regulatory authorities, due to change in business 
strategy, merger/acquisition or any other reason resulting in losing its original legal identity, it 
must inform the MoD/User Directorate at the earliest about its intent to change name on its 
official letter head signed by the authorised representative. If, at any stage of the defence 
procurement 
phase, 
approval 
of 
merger/amalgamation/acquisition 
is 
granted 
by 
courts/regulatory authorities, resulting in change of name, then the vendor should submit self 
authenticated relevant documents such as new certificate of incorporation issued by an 
appropriate Registrar of Companies (ROC) along with Novation Agreement, an undertaking 
by the new company whose format is given at Annexure to this Appendix, at the earliest after 
grant of approval by ROC. If any foreign company is involved in the ‘merger and acquisition’ 
and if documents are in languages other than English, then a self-certified/official/legal 
translation of the document along with the original as well as RBI approval should also be 
submitted. The onus of submitting all relevant, self-authenticated, authentic documents 
lies with the vendor affected. 
 
2. 
User Directorate/MoD shall process the change of name of vendor case for consent of 
the approving authority concerned. On grant of consent, vendor would be informed and he 
would have to submit new Pre-Contract Integrity Pact (PCIP), Integrity Pact Bank Guarantee 
(IPBG) and any other applicable financial instruments/documents bearing the new entity 
name. 
 
Approving Authorities for the Change of Name of Vendor while Participating in the 
Procurement Process 
 
3. 
The approving authorities for change of name of vendor in all cases will be as 
follows:- 
 
(a) 
Pre-Contract Stage.     Case is to be processed by SHQ. Consent is to be 
given by DG (Acquisition) for schemes granted AoN by DPB/DAC and 
VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/CISC/DG ICG for schemes granted AoN by SPB (i.e. for all 
schemes under delegated powers).  
 
(b) 
Post-Contract Stage.        The case has to be processed by SHQ/Acquisition 
Wing for consent of Raksha Mantri or VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/CISC/DG ICG (in case 

159 
 
of delegated power cases). On obtaining consent, a corrigendum to the sanction letter 
reflecting the change in name of vendor is to be issued.  
 
Checklist for Vendor 
 
4. 
Whenever the company applies to the regulatory authorities for ‘change of name of 
company’, it must inform SHQ/MoD through a letter about proposed change of name and 
reason for the same.

deliverables is affected, Bidder is to undertake re-packing to restore the preserved life to the 
specified period at his own cost. In cases of any delay in STW/installation/integration 
trials/commissioning, attributable to the Buyer, and if preservation period expires during the 
storage prior installation/post installation and prior trials (as applicable), the deliverables are 
to be re-preserved by the Bidder against payment of de-preservation/re-preservation charges

Note: The above Para is to be modified as per the requirements of the case. The details/scope 
of the trials, if other than NCNC trials in India, is to be included as per the decisions during 
AoN by the DAC/DPB/SPB.  
 
Field Evaluation Trials  
 
48. 
For an equipment to be introduced in service, it is mandatory that it successfully 
clears all stipulated tests/trials/evaluations as per RFP. The trial evaluation process comprises 
of the following phases. (SHQ may amend this paragraph as per the requirement of the 
proposal):- 

187 
 
 
(a)  
User Trials.  These will involve functional testing by user of the equipment in 
various specified conditions as per requirement and may be done in more than one 
phase. Trials will be conducted only pertaining to conditions where the equipment is 
most likely to be deployed. In other conditions where the probability of deployment is 
not high, appropriate vendor certifications confirming the functional effectiveness 
under such conditions can be given and simulations based testing can be resorted to 
wherever applicable. In case, equipment fielded requires any repairs/modifications 
during the course of trials, these in situ servicing, repair, maintenance actions or 
modifications as requested by the vendor will be permitted. Towards this, Vendors 
shall ensure availability of requisite maintenance teams/ experts onsite during the 
conduct of trials. Permission for trial equipment to move out of the trial location for a 
defined period for such repairs or modifications can be permitted on a case to case 
basis. In single vendor cases permission for the above may be permitted by the OIC 
Trials itself. 
 
In case trials are to be conducted at Buyer’s premises or onboard Buyer’s 
platform/vessel, clear demarcation of responsibilities between Buyer and Bidder 
towards conduct of Trials in terms of transportation, POLs, consumables and other 
requirements, on case to case basis, needs to be specified. 
 
(b)  
Technical Trials.  Technical trials will be conducted by QA agency as per 
Technical Evaluation Plan (to be specified at Para 51 below) to assess conformance to 
the quality requirements, standards and specifications. Equipment/assemblies/sub-
assemblies will be subjected to environmental tests wherever applicable. As far as 
possible, physical evaluation will only be carried out of critical parameters and other 
parameters will be evaluated based on vendor certification duly supported by 
certification by NABL accredited laboratories/internationally recognised laboratories. 
Towards this, Bidder will submit the technical documentation and draft ATP as part of 
technical bid or at least one month before commencement of FET. QA agencies will 
finalise ATP in respect of all Bidders during Technical trials. 
(c)  
Maintainability Evaluation Trial (MET).   MET to address maintenance, 
repair and spares support aspects of acquisition, wherever feasible, will be undertaken 
through the OEM documentation concurrent to the User Trials.  Essential tests 
towards establishing maintainability would be undertaken to establish adequacy of 
maintenance tools, test equipment and spares utilisation. Actual stripping of the 
equipment to establish adequacy of maintenance tools, test equipment and spares 
utilisation will ideally be undertaken, where considered necessary by the Buyer.  
 
(d)  
EMI/EMC Evaluation.  This will consist of either review of reports of 
EMI/EMC tests already conducted as part of qualification testing from authorised labs 
or physical conduct of tests to ascertain compatibility. EMC/ EMI Evaluation would 
be carried out by designated testing centers like Army Center for Electromagnetics 
(ACE), Mhow etc. on parameters having direct bearing on the operational 
employability of the equipment based on desired standards as given out in the Trial 
Directive. For remainder parameters, certification of accredited labs can be accepted. 
 
(e)  
Secrecy Testing. (if applicable) 
 

188 
 
 
Note: Trials. The scope of FET, Production stage QA checks/inspection and Acceptance 
trials shall be carefully formulated in such a way that they are adequate and justified.  Where 
ab-initio design & development is involved then these are to be part of validation process of 
design. These are not necessary to be done for already in –service/ bulk orders/ repeat orders 
or on all sets of the equipment unless specifically needed and included in SQRs/AoN. The 
FET may consist of User trials, Technical & Environmental Evaluation, Maintainability 
Evaluation Trial, EMI/EMC Evaluation and Secrecy grading depending on the SQRs.  The 
Flow Chart for arriving at necessary details is provided  at Annexure II to Appendix C to 
Chapter II of DAP 2020. 
 
49. 
Cases involving Essential Parameters ‘B’ (specified at Appendix A) would be trial 
evaluated after the signing of the contract as provided in Para 14(b) of Chapter II of DAP 
2020. However, Trials for Essential Parameters ‘B’, may be conducted at the FET stage, if 
any Bidder(s) claims that the equipment fielded by them for FET can meet Essential 
Parameters ‘B’ and such Bidders are willing to get their equipment trial evaluated for 
Essential Parameters ‘B’ at FET stage (a written undertaking in this regard will be given by 
such Bidder(s) to SHQ prior to date of commencement of FET). 
 
Note: Cases involving equipment that need to undergo secrecy grading must incorporate 
details that the Bidders need to provide as part of the technical offer. These details can be 
sought by SHQ based on a Proforma to be given by HQ DRDO.50.  Commercial offers will 
be opened only of Bidders whose equipment is short-listed, after technical trials and 
evaluation and who have also submitted the offset offers (if applicable) and these have been 
accepted technically. In other words, the equipment would be required to be trial evaluated 
and found suitable prior to commencement of any commercial negotiations. (If trials are not 
proposed then the words ‘trials and’ may be deleted).  
 
Quality Assurance Instructions & Technical Evaluation Plan  
 
51.  
QA instructions and Technical Evaluation Plan will be stated by the concerned QA 
agency. Bidder is to submit a Draft Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP) along with the 
Technical bid or at least one month before commencement of FET, as per the QA instructions 
and Technical Evaluation Plan.  Based on the draft ATP, the ATP will be finalised by the 
Buyer’s QA agency with Bidder during Technical Trials. In cases where no FET is to be 
conducted, ATP will be finalised at the CNC stage.  ATP shall be included in the contract at 
the time of finalisation with successful bidder. ATP will lay down the tests to be carried out 
during PDI and JRI. It shall be ensured that there are no repetition of QA tests in PDI and 
JRI. The JRI would normally be restricted to quantitative checks only, except where check 
proof is required to be carried out. In case PDI/JRI are planned to be conducted by authorised 
Third Party Inspection (TPI) Agencies, the same will be spelt out in the QA instructions and 
the details included in the finalised ATP. QA of equipment will be carried out as per finalised 
QA plan in the contract. For technical trials by QA agencies, the Bidder will arrange for 
requisite test facilities at OEM premises/accredited laboratories for establishing conformance. 
The successful Bidder would also be required to provide those test facilities at OEM 
premises/accredited laboratories for quality assurance, which are not available with QA 
agencies. Details of the same will be intimated to the Bidder during finalisation of  ATP in   
Technical trials.  
QA agencies shall mention the broad Quality Assurance instructions) in RFP along with 
associated charges, if any,, which will include indicative reference for number of samples for 

189 
 
 
destructive tests e.g., firing of missiles, ammunition, electronic assemblies/sub-assemblies etc, 
to assure quality and reliability of the equipment. In case the procurement is being done for 
more than one service, the QA of the lead service will be responsible for all QA aspects for 
the entire case, to include PDI and JRI for the entire quantities.

(THIS PAPER LAYS OUT GENERAL GUIDELINES. MAY BE AMENDED IN 
CONSULTATION WITH PRODUCTION AGENCY AND OTHER AGENCIES 
INVOLVED TO MAKE IT EQUIPMENT SPECIFIC) 
 
 
TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY (TOT)  
 
1. 
Preamble. 
 
(a) 
ToT shall be provided to the designated Production Agency(s) (to be decided 
prior to issue of RFP). The key technologies for ToT should be identified prior to 
issue of RFP jointly by the designated production agency, Defence Research and 
Development Organisation and Ministry of Defence. 
 
(b) 
Technology used shall be current, State-of-the-art as used in the 
contemporary systems. Critical technology aspects having bearing on ToT evaluation 
need to be specified on a case to case basis. 
 
(c) 
The ToT shall be comprehensive, covering all aspects of design/development, 
manufacturing know-how and detailed technical information which will enable the 
Production Agency 
to 
manufacture of systems, sub-systems, assemblies, 
components, materials etc by Indian ToT partner as well as for repair, overhaul, 
besides production from SKD/CKD/IM Kit, production from raw material and 
component level. Design data shall include the details that are needed to give design 
disposition during production on deviation/concession; modify/upgrade the license 
product and substitute parts and systems of the license product as required by the 
certifying agency and the production agency. 
 
(d) 
The OEM is required to provide the latest version of Configuration Control 
Document which will provide detailed breakdown of the product structure in terms of 
lower level subsystems/assemblies/sub-assemblies/modules/detail parts/PCBs/wiring 
diagrams etc with their latest modification status. All updates during the term of the 
Agreement should be provided as and when issued free of cost. Consolidated list of 
updates during the year should be provided during the first quarter of the subsequent 
year. 
 
(e) 
Vendor should submit an undertaking that he would provide and support 
complete ToT for phased manufacture to the buyer or his authorised Indian 
Organisation for the System and its sub-systems, modules, assemblies and detailed 
parts/components. Support will be provided for a minimum period of 20 years on long 
term basis after the last unit is produced under the present proposal. 
 
(f) 
The vendor should provide total support and facilitate ToT of the sub- 
systems from his sub-vendors/OEMs, if desired by the buyer. 
 

207 
 
 
(g) 
(To be included on as required basis) Vendor should submit an undertaking not 
to exceed* budgetary price for the Transfer of Technology covering the following 
parameters:- 
 
(i) 
License fee. 
 
(ii) 
Documentation. 
 
(iii) 
Technical Assistance. 
 
(iv) 
Training.  
 
(v) 
Materials.  
 
(vi) 
Spares.  
 
(vii) 
Tooling. 
 
(viii) Special Tools.  
 
(ix) 
Standard tools. 
 
(x) 
Ground Support & Test Equipment. 
 
(xi) 
Programme Management. 
 
(xii) 
Special Infrastructure facilities deemed necessary to support the 
operations. 
 
*Note: Above ‘not to exceed’ budgetary quotes are to be provided for both Licensed 
production and Repair/Overhaul separately. Vendor may note that this ‘not to exceed’ 
budgetary price will be used for commercial evaluation. Vendor selected after technical & 
commercial evaluation will enter into detailed contractual negotiations on various aspects of 
the Transfer of Technology to the buyer or his authorised Indian organisation based on the 
“Not to exceed” budgetary quotes. 
 
(h) 
It is likely that some of the assemblies/sub-assemblies/modules/PCBs used in 
the realisation of higher level assemblies/sub-systems and systems are manufactured 
by the OEM’s vendors/sub-contractors either based on Engineering documentation 
provided by the OEM or developed by the OEM’s vendors/sub-contractors based on 
procurement specifications provided by the OEM. Further, as a result of multiplicity 
of technologies involved and for reasons for price competitiveness arising due to 
economies of scale, some of the items used in the manufacture of licensed product 
may be bought out by the OEM from vendors as ‘fully finished’ against the 
procurement specifications provided by him. 
 
(j) 
Although, not desirable, some of the components/process specifically 
developed by the OEMs for use in the manufacture of licensed product may be 
classified by them as ‘Proprietary’ and not included within the scope of ToT offered 
to the Production Agency. 

208 
 
 
 
(k) 
To bring in a fair comparison between the ToT offered by various OEMs as 
also to have a fair assessment of the depth of technology being transferred, OEMs are 
required to identify each item (system/ sub-system/ assembly/ sub-assembly/ module/ 
detail parts/ PCB etc) in the product structure under the following categories, as may 
be applicable and provide information on the relative price for each of the items in 
the product structure as percentage of product cost:- 
 
(i) 
Category -1. 
Items, for which complete ToT, i.e., Engineering and 
Manufacturing documentation to enable the Production Agency carryout 
fabrication, assembly and test of the item from CKD/IM Kit level as the case 
may be, is being provided by the OEM, may be classified under the head 
“CToT”. 
 
(ii) Category -2. 
Items which are manufactured by the OEM’s 
Subcontractors based on engineering documentation provided by the OEM 
and these Engineering Documentation are being provided by the OEM to the 
Production Agency, may also be classified under the head “CToT”. 
 
(iii) Category -3. 
 
(aa)  
Items in respect of which development and manufacture 
by the OEM has been subcontracted to its vendors/sub-contractors 
based on only the procurement specifications provided by him and the 
OEM is not in a position to provide any additional technical 
information to the Production Agency except the procurement 
drawings/specifications provided by him to his vendors/sub-
contractors, may be classified under the head Single Vendor 
“Subcontract”. For the purpose of evaluating the depth of ToT, it will 
be presumed that the ToT in respect of these items for indigenous 
manufacture is not provided. OEM shall ensure authorisation to its 
vendors/sub-contractors to supply items, manufactured against OEM’s 
specifications to the Production Agency against its purchase orders. 
 
(ab)  
However in such case, the OEM in collaboration with his 
vendor/subcontractor, is required to provide the Production Agency, 
maintenance Documentation, the recommended list of spares for 
repair and overhaul as may be applicable and maintenance training at 
the vendor’s/subcontractor’s premises, then such vendor items are 
may be classified under the head ‘Limited ToT for maintenance 
support’, i.e, “M-ToT”. 
 
(iv) Category-4. 
 
(aa) 
Items including catalogue/standard items sourced by the 
OEM against his procurement specifications as ‘Fully Finished’, may 
be classified as “Bought Out”. Evidently ToT for such items for 
indigenous manufacture will not be available and the OEM will be 
able to provide only the procurement drawings/specifications, sources 
of supply. OEM has to ensure the availability of such items or its 

209 
 
 
equivalents during the life cycle of the product. However, in respect of 
some of the selected items in this category, if the OEM, in 
collaboration with his vendor, is able to provide the Production 
Agency documentation for maintenance, recommended list of spares 
for repair and overhaul as may be applicable and maintenance training 
in the vendor’s premises, then such items may also be classified 
under the head ‘limited ToT for maintenance support’ i.e. “M-ToT”. 
 
(ab) 
OEM shall ensure periodical review of obsolescence, study of 
the Bill of Items (BOIs) and provide a retrieval scheme for a minimum 
period of 15/20 years from the production of last unit under the present 
proposal. 
 
(v) 
Category -5. 
Some of the items for which the ownership of 
Design and Manufacturing Documentation is available with the OEM, but 
the OEM is not willing to transfer the technology to the Production 
Agency may be classified under the head ‘Proprietary’ items. The list of 
such 
items 
shall 
be 
far 
and 
few 
and 
generally 
restricted 
to 
components/processes specifically developed by the OEM for the licensed 
product. No item in the product structure which is critical either from the 
technology point of view or from the point of view of significant value 
addition or which constitutes a significant relative percentage of the product 
cost (say > 10%), will be acceptable under the head “Proprietary items”. 
Further, at any stage during the life cycle of the Product, if the OEM intends 
to discontinue the production of Proprietary items, the complete technical 
documentation in respect of these items available with the OEM or his 
subcontractors will be passed on to the Production Agency to enable 
indigenous manufacture or establish alternative routes of meeting the 
requirement. Also, a base price for such items with an escalation formula for 
future supplies shall be given for slab quantities by OEM. 
 
(l) 
The OEMs have to ensure that the depth of Technology being transferred shall 
enable the Production Agency achieve value addition commensurate with a minimum 
30% of the relative cost of the licensed Product through indigenous manufacture in 
case of CKD kit based ToT and a minimum of 60% of the relative cost of the licensed 
product through indigenous manufacture in case of IM Kit based ToT (Percentage of 
indigenous value addition may vary based on the product). 
 
(m) 
No single sub-system/assembly/sub-assembly, which constitutes more than 
10% of the cost of Licensed product, shall be without ToT option to the Production 
Agency. In case, such a sub-system/assembly belongs to the ‘bought out’ category, 
then the OEM as a prime bidder of the licensed product shall bid in consortium with 
the concerned vendors with separate ToT proposal for which items included in the bid 
directly from the relevant vendor. The bid for supplied/ToT in such a case shall be 
evaluated as an integrated composite proposal. 
 
(n) 
OEM shall assist the production agency and take the lead to obtain 
maintenance related ToT to the maximum extent possible in respect of items covered 
under category 3 and 4, from his vendor/sub-contractors.

repairs for the entire life cycle of the equipment. The scope of these repairs is 
elaborated subsequently. You are required to take into consideration these aspects 
while preparation of your maintenance plans. Initially the spares would be in the form 
of MRLS for a period of        years. The provision of spares subsequently would be 
through the identified Indian entity through a separate contract. 
 
(c) 
The spares, repairs and services support required from vendor for ToT to 
Indian entity would be implemented under long term contract. The proposal for 
Maintenance Transfer of Technology (MToT) shall also include Active Obsolescence 
Management through life cycle support of the equipment including upgradation of 
system/subsystem/components on completion of its fair service life. 
 
3.

 PRODUCT SUPPORT 
 
 
Note: The Repair and Maintenance Philosophy is only indicative and pertains to a 
particular service. SHQ concerned may amend this as per their requirement. No blanks to 
be left.  
 
1. 
Maintenance Philosophy. 
Maintenance of the equipment is structured on three 
different levels.  The Maintenance philosophy can be categorised into ‘O’, ‘I’ & ‘D’ levels 
depending upon the technological complexity of the equipment as under:- 
 
(a) 
‘O’ Level.   Includes Unit and Field Repairs (1st & 2nd Level). 
 
(i) 
Unit Repairs. Repairs, carried out within the unit holding the 
equipment using tools supplied by the manufacturer as per scaling. These 
repairs generally pertain to cleaning, lubrications, minor repairs and 
replacement of components and minor assemblies including Line Replaceable 
Units (LRUs) etc, carried out without any sophisticated tools or test 
equipment. The manufacturer is required to provide the following as per 
provisions in the RFP for carrying out such repairs :- 
 
(aa) 
Table of Tools and Equipment (TOTE) with each equipment 
including operators manual.  
 
(ab) 
Scaling of Special Maintenance Tools (SMT), Special Test 
Equipment (STE) and Special Equipment (SE) as required. 
 
(ii) 
Field Repairs. Repairs carried out at field/flotilla/station level or 
equivalent service organisation by technicians specially trained for the 
purpose, requiring special tools and spares provided additionally for the class 
of the equipment. These repairs comprise replacement of common Line 
Replaceable Units (LRUs), sub-modules, other components beyond the 
holding of units and repairs undertaken beyond a unit level. Normally, a 
field/station workshop covers such repairs of a group of units holding the said 
class of equipment and their number will be stated based on equipment 
deployment pattern. The manufacturer in addition to the basic unit level 
SMTs/STEs/SE, is required to provide the following:- 
 
(aa) 
Quantity and specification of spares up to sub-Module level, 
other replaceable components that need to be stocked for a specified 
population and class of the equipment. 
 

240 
 
 
(ab) 
Additional Special Maintenance Tools and Test Equipment 
needed for each such field/flotilla/station work shop. 
 
(b) 
‘I’ Level. Includes 3rd level Intermediate Repairs by Corps Zone 
workshop/Dockyard/Base Repair Depot or other similar service organisation. These 
are extensive or special repairs carried out to include component level repairs. This 
level of repair envisages special diagnosis and repairs of the repairable inventory up 
to Printed Circuit Board (PCB) level, major assemblies, interface equipment/software 
and other components beyond the scope of field/flotilla/station level repairs. These 
repairs are carried out in the designated workshops by technicians specially trained for 
this purpose requiring special tools and spares and the number of such facilities will 
be stated based on equipment deployment pattern. The manufacturer is required, 
among others, to provide the following:- 
 
(i)

(c) 
‘D’ Level.   These repairs include 4th level extensive Base Overhauls (BOH)/ 
Depot level Repairs which are either routine and planned or necessitated due to major 
repairs/renewal requirements requiring stripping and rebuilding of equipment. 
Extensive repairs of components / sub-assemblies and overhaul of the complete 
equipment is carried out by this facility and due to the complexity requires specific 
technical knowledge, infrastructure, related documentation, experience and proper 
quality control. Post such repairs, detailed trials are conducted usually by the 
overhauling agency, prior to handing over of the equipment to the unit for operational 
exploitation. Depending on the population of the equipment, such facilities may be 
established in the country. For this, the manufacturer is required to provide the 
following:- 
 
(i) 
All Special Maintenance Tools, jigs, fixtures and test equipment for 
carrying out repairs up to component / PCBs/ module level. 
 
(ii)

 Payment Deductions and Damages for Shortfalls in AMC/CMC/PBL/LCSC 
Services (where applicable).  
 
The clause for payment deductions and damages for shortfall in AMC/CMC/PBL/LCSC 
services is to be formulated on case to case basis. A sample formulation is given below. 
 
In case the cumulative downtime exceeds ___ (working days) in the ____ (Quarter/Half-
year/Year), payment will be deducted. The total downtime will be calculated at the end of the 
____ (Quarter/Half-year/Year) and payments will be deducted. The total payments to be 
deducted will be calculated as follows:- 
 
(a) 
Payments would be deducted on pro-rate basis for the duration, by which 
cumulative downtime exceeds __ (working days), as follows:- 
 
(i) 
Per year AMC/CMC/PBL/LCSC = ‘X1’ 
 
(ii) 
Period by which cumulative downtime exceeds the specified cumulative 
downtime, in days  = ‘Y1’ 
 
(iii) 
Payment Deduction = ‘Z1’,  
Where Z1 = [(X1/ Number of days in the year) * Y1] 
 
(b) 
In addition, damages would be deducted to the sum of 0.1% of the per annum 
AMC/CMC/PBL/LCSC cost per day, for the duration, by which cumulative downtime

subject to the maximum value of this damages not being higher than 5% of the annual 
AMC/CMC/PBL/LCSC cost. 
 
 
9.  
Denial Clause.  
In case the delay in delivery is attributable to the Seller or a 
non-force majeure event, the Buyer may protect himself against extra expenditure during the 
extended period by stipulating a denial clause (over and above levy of LD) in the letter 
informing the Seller of extension of the delivery period. In the denial clause, any increase in 
statutory duties and/or upward rise in prices due to the Price Variation Clause (PVC) and/or 
any adverse fluctuation in foreign exchange are to be borne by the Seller during the extended 
delivery period, while the Buyer reserves his right to get any benefit of downward revisions 
in statutory duties, PVC and foreign exchange rate. Thus, PVC, other variations and foreign 
exchange clauses operate only during the original delivery period. The format for extension 
of delivery period/performance notice under the Denial clause is at Annexure VI to 
Appendix M. 
 
10. 
Price Variation Clause (applicable only for cases with delivery period more than 
36 months). Price variation will be applicable to Indian Rupee component of the Contract

determination will be based on overall quoted prices as indicated in the Price Bid Format. 
The PVC will be applicable 18 months after the last date of bid submission till the date of bid 
opening and thereafter from the Effective date of Contract. The PVC will be applied during 
payments as per Payment Schedule at Annexure VII to Appendix M. The indices for 
calculation of the price variation along with weightages are enumerated below. The variations 
are calculated by using the indices published by Government or Chambers of Commerce 
periodically. The guidelines for calculation of Price Variation are specified at Annexure VIII

time of delivery of the goods stipulated in the contract is deemed to be of the essence of the 
contract, it appears that (fill in the outstanding quantity) are still outstanding even though the 
date of delivery has expired. Although not bound to do so, the time for delivery is extended 
from (fill in date) to (fill in date) and you are requested to note that in the event of your 
failure to deliver the goods within the delivery period as hereby extended, the contract shall 
be cancelled for the outstanding goods at your risk and cost.

Notes: 
 
1. 
Indicative Payment Terms for Projects with Installation and Commissioning. 
If 
installation, Integration, STW, Commissioning and Acceptance trials of delivered goods does 
not involve establishing fructification of a new concept/Development project/validating a 
proof of concept/IDDM concept, about 10 to 15% of total value of the goods is to be retained 
for installation, integration, STW, Commissioning and Acceptance. 

285 
 
 
2. 
Indicative Payment Terms for Projects with Installation and Commissioning 
Involving Validation of Design/ Proof of Concept. If 
installation, 
Integration, 
STW, 
Commissioning and Acceptance trials of delivered goods involves establishing fructification 
of a new concept/Development project/validating a proof of concept/IDDM concept, about 25 
to 30% of total value of the goods is to be retained for installation, integration, STW, 
Commissioning and Acceptance. 
 
3. 
Deliveries in Lots/Batches – Definition of Lot/Batch. 
In case delivery is in 
lots/batches and payment is being made as per the lots/batches, completion of common 
deliverables like documentation and Training can be linked to completion of a particular Lot/ 
Batches required, to be indicated by linking with relevant sl. of the lot/batch. If such linking 
of deliverables is not indicated in the above table, each delivery, including documentation 
and training shall be deemed as independent deliverable. 
 
4. 
Recommended Methodology for Payment in Case of delayed Commissioning. 
If 
in spite of all efforts to logically evolve the delivery schedule, the goods are ready for 
delivery and corresponding infrastructure/associated system/platform is not available for 
installation and integration in a reasonable time, the supplier cannot be denied payment for 
work accomplished in conformity with the contract schedule. If the next stage of work cannot 
be executed by the supplier due to delay on the part of the buyer in providing requisite 
infra/associated system/platform for STW, commissioning and Acceptance trials in as 
reasonable time, the payment terms should cater for making 60-70% of the associated stage 
payment (even before accomplishing requisite work) against submission of a bank guarantee 
for equivalent amount and firm undertaking from the supplier that they will fulfil all the 
obligations immediately on availability of requisite infra/associated system/platform.  
 
(If provisions as per Sl 4 above are envisaged, the same shall be included in the RFP as 
‘Special Conditions of the RFP’)

GUIDELINES FOR PRICE VARIATION CLAUSE 
 
1. 
In cases where only Indian Vendors participate, Price Variation Clause (PVC) will be 
applicable for cases with delivery period more than 36 months. 
 
2. 
PVC will apply only to the Indian Rupee component of the cost of basic equipment at 
Sl (A) of Price Bid Format at Appendix N. L1 determination will be based on overall quoted 
prices as indicated in the Price Bid Format.  
 
3. 
Maximum PVC applicable will be up to ___% of Price Variation (could be percentage 
per annum or an overall ceiling or both) and will not be applicable if the variation is within 
the band of +/- 2.5%. 
 
4. 
As Capital Acquisition generally has long gestation period with considerable time 
period between last date of bid submission and signing of contract, PVC will be applicable 
under following two categories:- 
 
(a) 
Pre-Contract Price Variation. 
It will be applicable on the Indian Rupee 
component of the quoted price of L1 Bidder. Price arrived post application of PVC 
will be used for negotiations during CNC. The PVC will be applicable 18 months 
after the last date of bid submission to the date of Bid opening. For calculation of 
PVC applicable for Pre- Contract PVC period, the base level (PVC reckoning date) 
will be the month and year 18 months after the last date of bid submission.   
 
(b) 
Post-Contract Price Variation. 
It will be applicable on the Indian Rupee 
component of the Base Contract Price specified in the Contract. For calculation of 
PVC during post contract period, the base level (PVC reckoning date) will be the 
month and year of Effective date of Contract. 
 
5. 
Applicability of PVC is illustrated in the following figure:-

Summary: 
 
 
• PVC applicable during Pre- Contract phase 18 months after the last date of bid 
submission (T1) to bid opening date (T2) 
• PVC applicable in post Contract phase after Effective date of Contract (TC) 
  
Illustrative Example 
 
• If the bids are opened within 18 months from last date of bid submission 
 
 No Pre- Contract PVC applicable 
 
 Post Contract PVC applicable from TC onwards. 
 Base level for Post Contract PVC will be month and year of TC. 
 
• If the bids are opened 24 months after last date of bid submission 
 
 Pre- Contract PVC applicable for period between T1 and T2. 
 Base level for Pre-Contract PVC will be month and year of T1. 
 
 Post Contract PVC applicable from TC onwards. 
 Base level for Post Contract PVC will be month and year of TC. 
 
6. 
PVC Formula (As at Rule 225(viii)(b) of GFR 2017). 
The formula for Price 
Variation should ordinarily include a fixed element, a material element and a labour element 
of the Indian Rupee component of the quoted price and Contract Price respectively for 
calculating pre-contract and post-contract PVC. The figures representing the material element 
and the labour element should reflect the corresponding proportion of input costs, while a 
fixed element may range from 10 to 25%. The portion of the price represented by the fixed 
element will not be subject to any variation. The portions of the price represented by the 
material element and labour element alone will attract Price Variation. The formula for Price 
Variation will thus be:- 
 
 
 
P1 = P0     F + a   M1     +  b   L1             
       
 
      M0              L0      
 
 
Where, P1 is the amount adjusted after applying PVC  
 
Note: 
For Pre-Contract Phase 
• P0 - Quoted price. 
• P1 – Price adjusted after applying Pre-Contract PVC (negotiations will be 
undertaken on this price) 
 
 

288 
 
 
For Post Contract Phase 
• P0 – Base Contract Price (price negotiated with L1 vendor) 
• P1 – Price payable after applying Post Contract PVC. 
 
 
F is the fixed element not subject to Price Variation. 
 
‘a’ is the assigned percentage to the material element in the Negotiated/Base Contract Price, 
as applicable. 
 
‘b’ is   the assigned percentage to the labour element in the Negotiated/Base Contract Price, 
as applicable. 
 
L0 and L1 are the wage indices at the base month and year and at the month and year of 
calculation respectively. M0 and M1 are the material indices at the base month and year and 
at the month and year of calculation respectively. 
 
If more than one major item or material is involved, the material element can be broken into 
two or three components such as Mx, My and Mz. 
 
7. 
For AMC/CMC/LCSC/PBL (to be amended as applicable). 
For services with 
insignificant inputs of materials), the Price Variation formula should have only two elements 
viz. a high fixed element and a labour element.  
 
8. 
Option Clause Contract. 
Price Variation Clause, FERV etc, if applicable and 
included in the original Contract, will also be applicable for Option Clause Contract. For 
arriving at prices payable, the Price Variation will be applied on the Base Contract price of 
the original Contract with the month and year of Effective date of Contract (TC) as Base 
Level Indices.

GST) and duties quoted by foreign bidders at Serials A to M of Para 2 
below [including the basic cost on DDP basis and the Basic Custom 
Duty (BCD) & IGST (as applicable)] would be considered for purpose 
of comparison of various bids. All the foreign bids will be brought to a 
common denomination in Indian Rupees by adopting Base Exchange 
Rate as BC Selling rate of the State Bank of India, Parliament Branch, 
New Delhi, on the ERV reckoning date (as defined in Annexure I 
to Appendix M), i.e., the last date of submission of commercial bids 
as per RFP.  
 
1.2.1.2  
In Case of Indian Bidders including Defence 
PSUs/OFs. All costs, taxes (including GST) and duties quoted by the 
vendor at Serials A to M of Para 2 below would be considered for 
purpose of comparison of various bids. 
 
1.2.2  If Custom Duty Exemption is Applicable for the Major 
Deliverables 
 
1.2.2.1  
In Case of Foreign Bidders. All costs of the 
Deliverables excluding taxes and duties (GST/IGST/BCD, as relevant) 
quoted by foreign bidders at Serials A to M of Para 2 below would be

cash outflows in successive years) -  
 
4.1 Net Present Value (NPV) is a variant of DCF method, which will be used by the 
Buyer for evaluation of Bids. The Net Present Value of a Bid will be equal to the sum 
of the present values of all the cash flows associated with it. The following formula 
will be used for calculating NPV of a bid -  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Where, 
 
NPV = Net Present Value 
 
At = Expected cash flow occurring at the end of year ‘t’ as mentioned in the 
Payment schedule of Bid 
 
n = Duration of cash flow stream 
 
r = Discounting Rate 
 
t = The period after which payment is done 
 
The bid with the lowest NPV would be selected. 
 
4.2. 
The Discounting rate will be __ %”. (Note-This will be the Government of 
India’s lending rate on loans given to state governments, as notified by Budget 
Division of Ministry of Finance annually)  
4.3. 
Structuring Cash Flows for Tenders/ Bids Received in the Same 
Currency. The cash outflows as shown in price bids will be taken into consideration. 
NPV of different bids will be calculated using the formula given above and the one 
having lowest NPV will be selected as L-1.  
4.4  
Structuring Cash Flows for Tenders/Bids Received in Different 
Currencies. Where bids are received in different currencies/combination of 
currencies, the cash outflow will be brought to a common denomination in rupees by 
converting foreign currency bids into rupees by taking into account the BC selling 

295 
 
 
rate of Parliament Street Branch of State Bank of India, New Delhi on the ERV 
reckoning date (as defined in Annexure I to Appendix M), ie the last date of 
submission of Commercial Bids as per RFP. Thereafter, the procedure as described 
above in Para 4.3 will be applied to arrive at NPV. 
4.5 
All bidders are required to indicate year-wise and currency-wise amount 
required as per their price bid in format given below. In case the firm a bidder does 
not provide year-wise cash flow details in price bid, the amount quoted in their price

CHAPTER III 
 
PROCEDURE FOR PROCUREMENT UNDER ‘MAKE’ AND ‘INNOVATION’ 
CATEGORIES 
 
Background 
 
1. 
Self- reliance in defence manufacturing continues to be an important pillar of India’s 
strategic autonomy. In line with the Government’s ‘Make in India’ programme, several 
initiatives have been taken in the recent years to build a robust defence industrial ecosystem 
capable of meeting existing and future requirements of the Armed Forces. The emerging 
dynamism of the Indian industry needs to be gainfully utilised to build domestic capabilities 
for designing, developing and manufacturing state of the art defence equipment.  
 
2. 
R&D and innovation remain important cornerstones of India’s defence production 
strategy. With the launch of ‘Start-Up India’ programme, India has become the hotspot of 
start-up activity in the world, having the third-largest start-up ecosystem globally.  These 
strengths need to be leveraged to catapult India to next level of frontier defence technologies, 
both for domestic use as also to foster exports.   
 
3. 
The indigenous ‘Make’, and ‘Innovation’ Categories outlined in this Chapter attempt 
to further build on these initiatives and provide a focussed, structured and significant thrust to 
development of defence design and production capabilities in the country. Projects under 
‘Make’ or ‘Innovation’ category, except ‘Make III’ will essentially pertain to products 
involving indigenous design, development and manufacturing. To enable Indian industry to 
leap frog to higher or complex technology, cases where Indian companies either hold the IPR, 
including where it has been acquired from the foreign companies, or have the ownership of 
the design of the main system/equipment, will be deemed to be indigenously designed and 
developed. In such cases, the companies will have to furnish undertaking as detailed at 
Appendix ‘A’ to Chapter I. 
 
4. 
The Chapter is divided in two sections; Section I pertains to indigenous ‘Make’ 
Categories, whereas, Section II refers to categories nurturing indigenous innovation. 
 
SECTION I –‘MAKE’ CATEGORIES 
 
5. 
The ‘Make’ Categories aim to achieve the objective of self-reliance by involving 
greater participation of Indian industrial eco-system including private sector through the 
following procedures:- 
 
(a) 
Make-I (Government Funded). 
Projects 
involving 
design 
and 
development of equipment, systems, major platforms or upgrades thereof by the 
industry. For Projects under Make-I sub-category, MoD will provide financial support 
upto 70% of prototype development cost or maximum ₹ 250 crores per Development 

322 
 
Agency (DA).  Funding would be released in a phased manner based on the progress 
of the scheme, as per terms agreed between MoD and the DA(s). However, the final 
percentage or upper limit of financial support to be provided may vary from case to 
case and would be dependent upon nature of the project and the fund support sought 
by the selected DAs for development of prototype. 
 
(b) 
Projects Under Make II and Make III. 
Projects under Make II and Make 
III would encompass equipment/ system/ platform or their upgrades or their sub-
systems/ sub-assembly/ assemblies/ components/ materials/ ammunition/ software, 
primarily for import substitution. 
 
(i) 
Make-II (Industry Funded). 
This would include design and 
development and innovative solutions by Indian vendor, for which no 
Government funding will be provided. In Make-II, where solutions have been 
offered even by a single individual or a firm as a Suo-Moto proposal, the cases 
would be progressed as a Resultant Single Vendor. However, SHQ should 
seek for multivendor options in such cases, if feasible, before progressing the 
case as Single Vendor Case. 
 
(ii) 
Make-III. 
This  although would not be designed/developed 
indigenously, but can be manufactured in India as import substitution for 
product support of weapon systems/equipment held in the inventory of the 
Services. Indian firms may manufacture these either in collaboration or with 
ToT from foreign OEMs. In this category, an Indian vendor can enter into a 
JV with OEM. 
 
6. 
Eligibility & Categorisation.    
 
(a) 
Make-I. 
 
 
(i) 
 Eligible for Indian vendor defined at Paragraph 20 including 
additional conditions at Paragraph 20(a) and Paragraph 20(b) of Chapter I. 
 
(ii) 
 Other technical and financial criteria will be as per Appendix F of 
Chapter III.   
           
           (b)      Make-II. 
The eligibility criteria will be as under:-  
 
(i)      Eligible for Indian vendor defined at Paragraph 20 including additional 
conditions at Paragraph 20(a) and Paragraph 20(b) of Chapter I. 
 
(ii)      For projects having cost of development phase ≤ Rs. 3 Cr and cost of    
procurement   phase   <   Rs.   100 Cr/year based on delivery schedule at the 
time of seeking AoN, there will be no commercial and financial criteria.  
 

323 
 
(iii) 
For all cases having cost of prototype development phase > Rs. 3 Cr 
and/or procurement cost > Rs. 100 Cr/ year based on delivery schedule at the 
time of seeking AoN, the entity should have:- 
 
(aa)     Average annual turnover of the applicant company for the last 
three financial years ending 31st March of the previous financial year, 
should not be less than 5% of the estimated cost of the project. In case 
of JV, the average annual turnover of the lead partner may be 
considered. 
 
(ab)    Net worth of the entities ending 31st  March of the  previous 
financial year should be “Positive”.  
 
(iv) 
Other Technical criteria will be determined out by concerned 
SHQ based on the project requirement. 
 
(v) 
Apart from entities eligible as per Paragraph 6(b) above, OFB & the 
‘Start-up’ recognized by Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal 
Trade (DPIIT) from time to time, shall be eligible to participate under ‘Make-
II’ procedure. 
 
 (c) 
Make III.

Other eligibility criteria same as Paragraph 6(b) (ii) to 6(b) (iv) of  
Make II. 
 
           (d) 
Successful development under Make I and Make II would result in 
acquisition, from successful Development Agency(ies) (DA/DAs), through the ‘Buy 
(Indian-IDDM)’ category with indigenous Design & Development and a minimum of 
50% IC. Schemes under Make III will be procured under the Buy ‘Indian’ category 
with a minimum of 60% IC.  
 
Innovation & Indigenisation Organisation (IIO). 
 
7. 
To provide impetus to indigenisation, each SHQ may establish an Innovation & 
Indigenisation Organisation within existing resources. The mandate of IIO/ SHQ will be as 
follows:- 
 
(a) 
Be responsible for spearheading innovation & indigenisation.

Advance Planning and Consultations 
 
9. 
Identification of Projects and Approval-in-Principle. 
SHQ, will identify the 
potential projects to be undertaken under each of the categories listed at Paragraph 5 above in 
consultation with industry. The list of such projects will be hosted on MoD/SHQ website and 
also shared with the industry. SHQ will also hold extensive consultations with the 
stakeholders. Industry can also forward Suo-Moto proposals under Make-II and Make-III. 
These proposals will be examined by SHQ in a time-bound manner, preferably within eight 
weeks. Potential projects identified under the ‘Make’ categories by SHQ, shall be deliberated 
and 'Approved-in-Principle' by a Collegiate Committee headed by Secretary (DP) with 
members from SHQ, Acquisition Wing, DDP, DRDO, MoD (Fin) (for non-delegated cases)/ 
IFA (for delegated cases). Projects once identified and accorded AIP under ‘Make’ categories 
shall not be retracted due to technology being developed by DRDO/DPSU/OFB. Proposals 
rejected by SHQ will be informed to the collegiate committee headed by Secretary DP. 

325 
 
10. 
Dissemination and Consultations with Industry.     Once AIP has been accorded, 
list of potential projects along with project briefs, questionnaire for industry, contact point 
details shall be uploaded on MoD and SHQ websites to seek Industry participation. SHQ may 
also provide timely feedback to industry on Suo-Moto proposals, which are either accorded 
AIP or not accepted for further pursuance. Once AIP has been accorded, a Project Facilitation 
Team (PFT) will be constituted by SHQ. The detailed modalities of PFT are given in 
succeeding paragraphs 
 
11. 
Annual Acquisition Plan (AAP). 
Make projects will be listed at Part C  of AAP as 
given in Paragraph 26 of Chapter I. Additional Proposals under  ‘Make-II’, ‘Make-III’ and 
‘Innovation’ categories will deem to be automatically included in AAP, after accord of AoN. 
However, AoN for such cases being processed under delegated powers will be accorded by 
DPB within the overall financial limits linked to anticipated budget, as prescribed by HQ IDS 
for AAP. The AAP will be accordingly revised and brought up for approval of the DPB as per 
next scheduled revision. 
 
12. 
 Incentives for MSMEs. 
Projects under the Make categories, with procurement 
not exceeding Rs 100 Cr/year based on delivery schedule at the time of seeking AoN will be 
earmarked for MSMEs. However, if at least two MSMEs do not express interest for a Make 
programme earmarked for them, the same shall be opened up for all, under the condition that 
interested MSME(s), if any at that stage and meeting the eligibility criteria, will get 
preference over Non- MSMEs in selection of DAs. 
 
Feasibility Studies. 
 
13. 
For ‘Make’ projects, SHQ shall carry out the feasibility study with the involvement of 
other stakeholders. Rep of FM/ IFA as applicable will be a stakeholder in feasibility study of 
Make projects. Industry associations including MSME associations would also be consulted. 
SHQ may engage consultants/experts to assist in preparation of feasibility study report. 
Funding requirements for such experts shall be borne by SHQ under relevant revenue budget. 
 
14. 
The Feasibility Study shall look into the following aspects:- 
 
(a) 
Make I. 
 
(i) 
A preliminary assessment of enabling technologies to realise the 
requisite equipment/system/platform/components or their upgrades. 
(ii) 
A preliminary assessment of capability of Indian industry to undertake 
design and development of the requisite equipment/system/platform or their 
upgrades, and to list out probable vendors. 
 
(iii) 
A preliminary assessment to ascertain the ‘Make’ category under 
which the case shall be processed. 
 

326 
 
(iv) 
Estimated time period for development. 
 
(v) 
Estimated cost of prototype development and for subsequent 
procurement  under ‘Buy (Indian-IDDM)’ category. 
 
(vi) 
In case of Make-I sub-category, feasibility study shall also recommend 
number of DAs to be selected. (As Make-I entails Government funding for 
prototype development, feasibility study will generally recommend not more 
than two DAs, however in case OFB is also participating it will be the third 
DA without government funding with the approval of DAC) 
 
(vii) 
‘Foreclosure’ criteria. 
 
(viii) Any other aspect considered important. 
 
(b) 
Make II and III. 
 
(i) 
New Proposals Including Suo-Moto Proposals.        Same as Make I 
as given in Paragraph 14(a)(i) to 14(a)(viii). 
 
(ii) 
Import Substitution. 
 
(aa) 
A preliminary assessment of capability of Indian industry to 
undertake design and development of the requisite equipment/ system/ 
platform or their upgrades, and to list out probable vendors. 
 
(ab) 
Estimated time period for development. 
 
(ac) 
Estimated cost of prototype development and for subsequent 
procurement under ‘Buy (Indian-IDDM)’ and Buy (Indian) category 
respectively. 
 
15. 
All stakeholders shall endeavour to complete feasibility study within twelve weeks 
from date of commencement for Make-II/Make-III Projects, and sixteen weeks for Make-I 
cases. Studies not completed within the stipulated period are to be brought to the notice of 
authorities according AIP, with reasons for delay.  
 
Preliminary Services Qualitative Requirements (PSQRs). 
 
16. 
SHQ in consultation with other stake holders would formulate the PSQRs, specifying 
essential and desirable parameters. 
 
 
 

327 
 
Categorisation and Accord of AoN. 
 
17. 
SHQ will prepare SoC and take AoN as per procedure outlined in Chapter II.  
 
18. 
In case of ‘Make-1’ category (Govt Funded), if OFB is also participating, it will be 
the third DA without government funding with the approval of DAC. The estimated cost of 
prototype phase and the final procurement of developed product would be indicated 
separately in the SoC. For Make–I category, the AoN will be sought based on the combined 
estimated cost of prototype phase and the cost of subsequent procurement under ‘Buy 
(Indian-IDDM)’ category. While for Make–II and Make–III categories, the AoN will be 
sought only for the cost of final procurement under ‘Buy (Indian-IDDM)’ category and 
Buy(Indian) respectively.  
 
19. 
The SoC will highlight the following: - 
 
(a) 
Recommended level of Indigenous Content (Minimum as prescribed for ‘Buy 
(Indian-IDDM)’ category and Buy(Indian)), if applicable. 
 
(b) 
The design and development of the system is indigenous (For Make I and II 
cases only). 
 
(c) 
Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) which can be exclusively committed, 
keeping in mind the financial viability of the identified project at  the production 
stage, after  the successful development of prototype. 
 
(d) 
Envisaged ‘Development Timeline’ for prototype.  
 
(e) 
Estimated development cost of prototype. 
 
(f) 
Estimated procurement cost of orders under Buy (Indian-IDDM) and 
Buy(Indian)category. 
 
(g) 
List of likely DAs. 
 
(h) 
Tentative time frame of procurement. 
 
(j) 
Acceptability of multiple technical solutions and division of ordered quantity 
among successful DAs, where applicable. 
 
20. 
Foreclosure Criteria. 
To 
ensure 
that 
development 
timelines 
do 
not 
inordinately deny the Services of critical capability, the SoC would also include mutually 
agreed ‘Foreclosure Criteria’ {provision for Service to seek foreclosure of the project in case 
the project does not progress in accordance with predicted developmental timelines or if the 

328 
 
equipment under development is overtaken by emergence of better technology (ies), etc}. 
Foreclosure clause would be exercised only with the approval of AoN according authority. 
 
 
(a) 
Make-I. 
 
 
(i) 
In case the project does not proceed according to the predetermined 
milestones and as agreed in the DPR and/or if there are undue time and cost 
overruns, or failure of the prototype(s) on staff evaluation or on account of any 
other reasons, the ‘Make-I’ project may be foreclosed in respect of the DA(s) 
concerned and proposal for foreclosure will be approved by the authority who 
had accorded AoN on the recommendation of PFT, through DPrB. Foreclosure 
criteria will be spelt out in the Project Sanction Order. 
 
(ii) 
In such cases, the total expenditure made by the DA(s) on the 
prototype development till foreclosure would be assessed and if excess funds 
with reference to MoD share have been paid to the DA(s), the same shall be 
recovered. If the expenditure is in excess of the amount paid, the balance shall 
be paid to the DA(s). The total amount paid to the DA(s) shall be written off 
with the approval of the competent authority. 
 
(b) 
Make-II and Make III. 
Under Make II and Make III, no government funding is 
envisaged for prototype development but there is an assurance of orders on successful 
development and trials of the prototype. No Foreclosure of the Project will be done after issue 
of Project Sanction Order, other than for reasons of default/ non-adherence to Project 
Sanction Order by Vendors. 
 
21. 
Multiple Technological/Source Solutions.   
For Make and Innovation Cases 
involving large quantities, and where multiple technological/source solutions are acceptable, 
SHQ may seek approval of AoN granting authority for dividing specified quantities (in the 
appropriate ratio) between two vendors with lowest bids (referred to as L1 & L2), who have 
successfully developed the prototype/product, on the condition that the second (L2) vendor 
accepts the price and terms & conditions quoted by the L1 vendor. In case L2 vendor refuses 
to meet the price or the terms and conditions of L1 vendor, either the L3 vendor could be 
offered the same option to match L1 price and terms/conditions, or the entire order could be 
placed on L1 vendor. This provision would need to be included in the SoC seeking AoN, and 
if approved, in the EoI/RFP, as applicable.  In case, Multiple Technological Solutions are not 
acceptable, the other successful vendor(s) will be issued a certificate by the DDP indicating 
that the product has been successfully trial evaluated, to facilitate vendors to explore other 
markets. 
 
22. 
Pre-Contract Integrity Pact (PCIP).      For Make and Innovation, Pre-Contract 
Integrity Pact (PCIP), as per   Chapter II of DAP 2020, shall apply mutatis mutandis, to 'Buy 
(Indian - IDDM)' and Buy(Indian) phase of 'Make’ projects. Depending upon the 
sensitivity/secrecy of the information related to the Project, participating vendors may be 

329 
 
asked to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement at the time of sharing the QRs/other sensitive 
information for certain projects as deemed necessary by SHQ. 
 
Validity of AoN. 
 
23. 
In case of ‘Make-I’ category, the AoN will be valid for one year from the date of 
accord of AoN, whereas for Make-II/III categories, the AoN will be valid for six months 
from the date of accord of AoN. In case where Expression of Interest (EoI), as described in 
succeeding paragraphs, is not issued within the stipulated period, SHQ shall seek revalidation 
of AoN with due justification. For cases where the original EoI has been issued within the 
stipulated period and later retracted for any reason, the AoN would continue to remain valid, 
as long as the original decision and categorisation (sub-category) remain unchanged and the 
subsequent EoI is issued within six months from the date of retraction of original Expression 
of Interest (EoI). 
 
Project Facilitation Team (PFT). 
 
24. 
SHQ will constitute a PFT under a two-star/one-star officer/ Director level officer. 
PFT will consist of representatives from SHQ, DDP, DGQA/DGAQA/DGNAI, 
MoD(Finance)/IFA as required and other experts if considered necessary. PFT is to act as the 
primary interface between the SHQ and the industry during the design and development 
stage. PFT may be constituted prior to seeking AoN if necessitated. 
 
25. 
For Make-I projects which are more complex in nature, SHQ may also engage 
consultant/ experts from public/private sector if considered necessary. Funding for the same 
shall be borne by SHQ under revenue budget.

The sealed commercial offers of the shortlisted vendors will be opened by 
SHQ (delegated cases)/Acquisition Wing (non delegated cases) along with reps of 
DDP at a predetermined date and time under intimation to vendors, permitting such 
vendors or their authorised representatives to be present. The final selection of DAs 
for cases upto ₹ 50 crores will be by SHQ and selection of DAs for cases above ₹ 50 
crores will be by DPrB. 
 
(b) 
The lowest prototype development cost offered in the limited commercial bid 
by the selected DAs will decide for 70 % of government funding, however not 
exceeding 250cr/DA. A cost variation of 15% of the lowest bid would be allowed for 
the other selected DAs.  However, in certain cases, if there is a requirement to change 
the cap of Rs 250cr/ DA, the same may be included in the SoC at the time of seeking 
AoN. 
 
36. 
Approval of Competent Financial Authority (CFA). 
For 
cases 
being 
progressed under Make-I sub-category, the financial sanction for project development, taking 
the relevant prototype development costs into account, would be obtained by the DDP as per 
delegation of financial powers detailed in Appendix C to this Chapter.  
 
37. 
Funding. 
Funds for development projects approved under this procedure shall be 
borne under the Account Head ‘Make Procedure-Prototype Development Account’ 
operated by respective SHQ. 
 
 

335 
 
38. 
Funding for Projects under Make-I Category. 
 
(a) 
The prototype development cost to be borne by the MoD will be decided 
based on the final cost-share agreed to by the selected DA(s) in the Project Sanction 
Order in accordance with Appendix H. 
 
(b) 
For all projects where MoD is required to fund part of the prototype 
development cost, an advance of 20% of the agreed share of the prototype 
development cost, will be paid against a bank guarantee for the equivalent amount.  
 
(c) 
Balance payment will be paid on completion of the stipulated 
stages/milestones. On completion of every stage against the milestones detailed in the 
DPR, DAs will submit claims for reimbursement to PFT. While submitting 
reimbursement claims, the Chief Executive Officer/a suitable nominee along with an 
authorised auditor/licensed Chartered Accountant will certify the incurred expenditure 
linked to a particular development stage. Based on the recommendations of PFT, SHQ 
will reimburse the development cost within sixty days, which may extend up to 
another 30 days in exceptional cases. The advance will be adjusted proportionately in 
subsequent payments as per the payment terms prescribed in DPR and bank 
guarantees will be proportionately and automatically reduced until full extinction. 
 
39. 
 SHQ will generally procure the MOQ approved in the AoN, post successful 
completion of FET. However, in case for reasons beyond control of the SHQ, the project is 
foreclosed, the DA(s) will be entitled for reimbursement of cost incurred by DAs with 
reference to MoD share for the prototype development within a period of three months. 
 
40. 
Time Overrun.      The approval of extension of timelines for any ‘Make-I’ project 
up to 25% of the timelines agreed upon in the approved DPR may be accorded by  CISC/ 
VCOAS/ VCNS/ DCAS/ DG ICG  based on the recommendations of Chairman Innovation & 
Indigenisation Organisation. For extension of time beyond 25%, the matter would be referred 
to DPrB.

SQRs. 
 
(c) 
The quantities in the ‘Buy (Indian-IDDM)’ phase cannot be reduced from the 
quantities indicated in AoN. 
 
42. 
Revised Commercial Offer.       The Revised Commercial bids on finalised SQRs 
will be solicited from the DAs prior to FET by Acquisition Wing. Any increase in revised 

336 
 
commercial bids from earlier commercial bid will be duly justified by the selected DAs. CNC 
will also consider the earlier commercial bids submitted at EOI stage while benchmarking. 
 
43. 
Field Evaluation Trials(FET) and Staff Evaluation. 
FET would be carried out 
as given in Chapter II. At this stage, no changes should be suggested which require 
redesigning of the system/sub system or technology upgrade. Such suggestions would be 
considered and implemented in subsequent phases of development of follow on models if 
required. The Staff Evaluation will be carried out as given at Chapter II of DAP2020. Once 
the Staff Evaluation report is accepted and final instalment under prototype phase as per DPR 
has been released, no more funds would be released from ‘Make Procedure- Prototype 
Development Account’. 
 
44. 
Benchmarking by Benchmark Models Committee. 
The benchmarking will be 
carried out as given out in Chapter II. The Benchmark model committee will consider the 
commercial bid submitted by vendors prior to development of prototype for benchmarking.  
  
45.

Commercial negotiations by Contract Negotiation Committee (CNC). 
 
(k) 
Award of Contract. 
 
(l) 
 The Flow Chart for procurement under Make II and Make III is attached as  
Appendix B. 
 
 
51. 
Issue of EoI.    SHQ duly assisted by PFT shall publish 'EoI' on MoD/DDP Website 
inviting Company (ies) to participate into the 'Make-II' project.  EOI for Make II projects 
could be on similar lines as EOI of Make I less the DPR, and as decided in the feasibility 
study or by SHQ. In addition, EoI shall also be issued to all companies which have shown 
interest to participate in the project during Feasibility Study. However, EoI may highlight the 
following: - 
 
(a) 
PSQRs. 
 
(b) 
Scope of the project including number of Prototypes required. 
 
(c) 
Time frames and critical activities. 
 
(d) 
Milestones. 

338 
 
 
(e) 
List of trials/items/facilities/consumables that will be provided free of cost and 
also specify 'number of times' such free trials will be allowed. 
 
(f) 
Quantities in 'Buy (Indian-IDDM)’ phase preferably covering requirements of 
five years. 
 
(g) 
Acceptability of Multiple Technological Solutions, if available. 
 
(h) 
Details of Evaluation Criteria for assessment of EOI. 
 
52. 
Evaluation of EoI Responses.       Responses to EoI shall be evaluated by SHQ duly 
assisted by PFT as per criteria given in EoI and shall be approved by CISC/VCOAS/ VCNS/ 
DCAS/ DG(ICG). All the shortlisted companies will be called Development Agencies (DAs). 
Also refer Paragraph 6 above of this chapter for indicative criteria for evaluation of EoI for 
shortlisting of Development Agencies in Make- II and Make III categories.  Project shall be 
progressed ahead even if only one EoI respondent is found meeting the eligibility criteria.  
 
53. 
Project Sanction Order. 
SHQ will obtain sanction for prototype development 
with 'Nil' financial implications from CISC/ VCOAS/ VCNS/ DCAS/ DG(ICG) and issue a 
Project Sanction Order (PSO) to all the DAs. The quantities in the 'Buy (Indian-IDDM)' 
phase cannot be reduced from the quantities indicated once the PSO has been issued. 
 
54. 
Development of Prototype.     After the issuance of PSO, PFT will act as the 
primary interface between the SHQ and the industry during the design and development 
stage. After the prototype has been developed, the PFT would carry out User Trial Readiness 
Review (UTRR) of the prototype before offering it for Field Evaluation. Request for Proposal 
(RFP) for 'Buy (Indian-IDDM) phase, duly vetted by Acquisition Wing (for non-delegated 
cases)/concerned SHQ (for delegated cases), will be issued to all vendors who have 
successfully developed the prototype and participated in the UTRR for submission of their 
commercial offer prior to commencement of FET. 
 
55. 
FET and Staff Evaluation.     FET would be carried out by the SHQ in close 
consultation with PFT and will be followed up by Staff Evaluation in accordance with 
Chapter II of DPP. At this stage no changes should be suggested, which require re-designing 
of the system/sub-system or technology upgrade. Such suggestions would only be considered 
and implemented in the subsequent/follow-on models, if required. The user may however 
recommend minor modifications with regard to ease of handling or maintainability. 
 
56. 
Commercial Negotiations by Contract Negotiation Committee (CNC).     The 
benchmark cost will be calculated on the basis of Last Purchase Price (where available) of the 
imported item being substituted and adjusted for inflation/escalation and other relevant 
factors. The CNC will carry out all processes from opening of commercial bids till 
conclusion of contract.  

339 
 
 
57. 
Negotiations in case of multivendor projects having procurement cost less than ₹150 
crores shall be carried out only in special circumstances with reasons to be recorded. 
However, CNC will carry out negotiations for all single vendor cases, other than resultant 
single vendor, irrespective of value of the project. For products which are being developed 
under 'Make-II' and ‘Make III’ as an import substitute and their prices are known, no 
benchmarking & no negotiation may be carried out, even in Single Vendor Cases, if the 
offered price is lower than Import price / Last Purchase Price (LPP) suitably adjusted for 
inflation/escalation and other relevant factors by 20% or more. However, in such cases, the 
CNC will satisfy itself that the price of the selected offer is reasonable with respect to the 
AoN cost and consistent with the quantity required. 
 
58. 
After the conclusion of negotiations, the procurement procedure would thereafter be 
same as for 'Buy (Indian- IDDM)' category from the successful DA/DAs, in accordance with 
Chapter-II of DPP. 
 
Other Aspects of Make II. 
 
59. 
Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs).      DA shall retain title or ownership and all 
other rights in intellectual property generated during the development of project. However, 
the Government shall have ‘March-in rights’ under which the Government can ask the 
contractor to grant, or may itself grant license for, inter alia, the following reasons: - 
 
(a) 
Where health and safety requirements so require the Government to act in 
public interest; 
 
(b) 
For National Security Reasons; 
 
(c) 
To meet requirements for public use not reasonably satisfied by the contractor; 
 
(d) 
For failure of the contractor to substantially manufacture the products 
embodying the     subject invention in India; or 
 
(e) 
For failure of the contractor to comply with any of the requirements laid down 
under these guidelines. 
 
60. 
Time Overrun. 
Typical expected timelines for undertaking 'Make-II' Projects 
are contained in Appendix L. Based on the complexity of the equipment, AoN according 
authority may approve extended timelines at the time of according AoN”. Approval of 
extension of timelines for any 'Make-II' project may be accorded by CISC/ VCOAS/ VCNS/ 
DCAS/ DGICG based on the recommendations of PFT. In case of only single vendor having 
offered the prototype within timelines stipulated in the Project Sanction Order, not more than 

340 
 
two-time extensions will be accorded to other vendors and thereafter the case shall be 
progressed as resultant Single Vendor Case (SVC). 
 
61. 
Procedure for Accord of AoN - Low Value ‘Make-II’ Projects.      ‘Low 
Value 
Projects’ for import substitution under Make-II procedure will follow a different procedure, 
as elucidated below: -  
 
(a) 
Proposals meeting the following criteria will be considered as ‘Low Value 
Projects’ under Make-II procedure: - 
 
(i) 
Technical specifications of the equipment/item and Last Purchase price 
(LPP) are known. 
 
(ii) 
The estimated cost of procurement does not exceed Rs 100Cr/year 
based on delivery schedule at the time of seeking AoN. 
 
(b) 
After accord of AIP, SHQ will prepare detailed Questionnaire within two 
weeks and upload the same on the MoD website, seeking necessary inputs required 
for preparing feasibility study report within a period of four weeks. Feasibility report 
will be completed within two weeks from last date of submission of detailed response 
to Questionnaire. Feasibility report finalized by Project Facilitation Team (PFT) will 
be construed as concurrence by all stakeholders. PFT will prepare the SoC based on 
Feasibility report and field the proposal directly to relevant AoN according authority, 
without circulating the SoC as otherwise required as per Chapter II of DAP. 
 
62. 
Deviations.     Any deviation from the prescribed procedure will be put up to DAC 
through DPrB for approval. 
 
MAKE-III  
 
63. 
Projects in this category would encompass equipment/systems/platforms or their 
upgrades or sub-systems/ sub-assembly/ assemblies/ components/ materials, ammunition, etc, 
which although not designed/developed indigenously, but are being manufactured in India as 
import substitution for product support of weapon systems/equipment held in the inventory of 
the Services.  
 
64. 
Indian firms may manufacture these either in collaboration or with ToT from foreign 
OEMs. Schemes under Make III will be procured under the Buy ‘Indian’ category with a 
minimum of 60% IC. The procedure to be followed after accord of AoN, will be akin to 
Make-II. 
 
 
 
 

341 
 
SECTION II – INNOVATION 
 
Introduction. 
 
65. 
MoD has set up Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) initiative under the 
Defence Innovation Organisation (DIO) and Technology Development fund ( TDF) under 
DRDO to use a multi-pronged approach and reach out/engage a large pool of 
innovators/technocrats/professionals/academicians including amongst the smaller enterprises, 
start-ups and MSMES, to foster innovation in a coherent, strategized, and integrated manner. 
SHQs also undertake Innovations through their internal R & D organisations. 
 
66. 
Procurement through Innovative solutions could be undertaken under following 
programmes: - 
 
(a) 
Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX). 
Projects 
of 
Start-ups, 
MSMEs etc. with low capital investments and high innovation would be pursued 
under the iDEX category. 
 
(b) 
Technology Development Fund (TDF) Scheme. Projects 
supported 
through TDF of DRDO for leveraging the domestic capabilities available with Indian 
Industries especially MSMEs including Start-ups. 
 
(c) 
Indigenous Development by Services through Internal Organisations. 
These would include projects where prototype development of equipment/system will 
be processed by the Services through their internal R&D organisations, such as Base 
workshop/Dockyards/ Base Repair Depots/ internal indigenisation Organisations/ 
Design Agency, etc. 
 
Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX). 
67. 
Details of the programme through DISC, SPARK and other such frameworks would 
be uploaded on the iDEX website www.iDEX.gov.in from time to time. The procurement of 
the final product will be processed under the Buy (Indian-IDDM) category. 
 
68. 
Like the Make-II category, Innovators/Industry/academia/start-ups can also forward 
suo-moto proposals for innovation to SHQ/iDEX-DIO. These proposals will be examined by 
SHQ/iDEX-DIO in a time-bound manner, preferably within two months. 
69. 
Development of Prototype.      A Project Facilitation Team (PFT) or nodal officer 
will be nominated by the SHQs for each iDEX case. PFT/Nodal officer will act as the 
primary interface between the SHQ and the industry during the design and development 
stage. After the prototype has been developed, the PFT would carry out UTRR of the 
prototype before offering it for User Trials. 
 

342 
 
70. 
Prototypes that have been successfully developed through the iDEX framework will 
be taken up by the SHQs for grant of AoN after finalisation of SQRs as per procedure 
outlined in Chapter II of DAP.The SoC will be prepared by the SHQs, with the involvement 
of important stakeholders such as HQ IDS, DRDO, DDP, Advisor (Cost) and MoD (Fin)/ 
IFA.  
 
71. 
Solicitation of Commercial Offers.     A commercial Request for Proposal (RFP) for 
'Buy (Indian-IDDM) phase will be issued to all DAs (iDEX Winners who have successfully 
developed the prototypes) for submission of their commercial offer prior to commencement 
of User trials. 
72. 
FET.    FET will be carried out as per Chapter II of DAP 2020, in coordination with 
iDEX. Project, where prototype of only a single firm/individual clears the trials, will be 
progressed as resultant single vendor. 
 
73. 
Follow-on Procedures. 
Subsequent procedures of Staff Evaluation, CNC and 
award of Contract will be same as for 'Buy (Indian- IDDM)' category, from the successful 
DA/DAs, in accordance with Chapter II of DAP. 
 
74. 
Developmental Agencies (DA).    All reference to the word DA in context of iDEX 
may be construed as referring to iDEX winners or iDEX fellows for iDEX cases. IPR 
provisions will remain same as Make-II category. 
 
Technology Development Fund (TDF) Scheme. 
 
75. 
Projects pursued under the category of Technology Development Fund (TDF) Scheme 
of DRDO will be progressed for acquisition under innovation Category. The details of TDF 
scheme are given out at website https://tdf.drdo.gov.in. The procurement will be made under 
the ‘Buy (Indian- IDDM)’ Category. A nodal officer from the Services may be nominated by 
the SHQs for each requirement under TDF Schemes who will be the member of the Project 
Monitoring and Mentoring Group (PMMG). 
 
76. 
Once the prototype(s) have been successfully developed through TDF Scheme, the 
SHQ would finalise the SQRs and prepare the SoC for grant of AoN in consultation with 
other stakeholders. In case procurement from more than one DA is envisaged, the same may 
be included in the SoC with justification. The AoN will be sought based on the cost of the 
final product under ‘Buy (Indian- IDDM)’ Category. 
 
77. 
Solicitation of Commercial Offers.      A commercial Request For Proposal (RFP) 
for ‘Buy (Indian – IDDM) phase, will be issued to all successful DA(s) for submission of 
their commercial offer prior to commencement of FET. Cases where prototype has been 
developed by a single DA, would not be treated as Single Vendor Case. 
 

343 
 
78. 
FET.  FET would be carried out by the SHQ in close consultation with PMMG and 
Directorate of TDF, DRDO as per Chapter II of DAP. 
 
79. 
Follow-on Procedures.     Subsequent procedures of Staff Evaluation, CNC and 
award of Contract will be same as for 'Buy (Indian- IDDM)' category, from the successful 
DA/DAs, in accordance with Chapter II of DAP. 
 
80. 
IPR of TDF Scheme.      Successful development under this scheme would result in 
the DAs jointly owning the IPR along with DRDO of the technology. Details are given in 
the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) promulgated by DRDO for TDF. 
 
Indigenous Development by Services through Internal Organisations. 
 
81. 
Products developed by Army Base Workshops, Naval Dockyards, Air Force Base 
Repair Depots and other service organisations for ‘in house’ requirements can be procured by 
the Services from these agencies under “Buy (Indian-IDDM)” or “Buy (Indian)” category 
with the approval of SPB.  The total cost of proposed quantity of each item required by SHQ 
under this procurement will be within the delegated powers of the SHQ.  The costing of such 
proposals will be vetted by the IFA with the respective Services.  SHQ can carry out user 
trials for the equipment without issue of RFP.  Procurement of the equipment will be done by 
the services by placing indents. 
 
82. 
Where 
the 
innovation 
is 
achieved 
within 
the 
Services, 
the 
concerned 
personnel/organisation may be allowed to file and hold the patent. 
 
Miscellaneous. 
 
83. 
AoN.     AoN for Innovation cases will be valid for six months. For cases where RFP 
is not issued within six months from accord of AON, SHQ shall seek revalidation of the AoN 
with due justification, as per the prescribed procedure.  
 
84. 
After successful development of Prototype, no changes should be suggested, which 
require re-designing of the systems/ sub- systems or technology upgrade. Such suggestions 
would only be considered and implemented in the subsequent/ follow-on models, if required. 
The user may however recommend minor modification with regard to ease of handling or 
maintainability. 
 
85. 
In ‘Innovation’ Categories, even if a single individual or a firm develops the 
prototype, it will be progressed as Resultant Single Vendor. 
 
86. 
Time Overrun.     Approval of extension of timelines for any project under 
innovation categories may be accorded by CISC/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DG (ICG)  based on 
the recommendations of PFT/nodal agency.  
 

344 
 
87. 
Buyer Nominated Equipment/Buyer Furnished Equipment (BNE/BFE).    SHQ 
will have the option to procure or incorporate products that have matured through the 
aforesaid innovative processes as BNE/BFE in future procurement cases, where applicable. 
These would not be considered as Single Vendor Cases. However, SHQ should seek for 
multivendor options in such cases, if feasible, before progressing the case as Single Vendor 
Case.

funds:- 
 
(a) 
Costs Allowability; 
 
(b) 
Cost Allocability; 
 
(c) 
Cost Reasonableness; and 
 
(d)  
Terms of the Contract. 

366 
 
 
8. 
The DA shall not charge any unallowable costs; and shall segregate the same from 
any proposal, billing, indirect cost pool or claim submitted to the Ministry. The following 
costs are specifically considered unallowable for the purpose of these guidelines:- 
 
(a)  
Bad Debts; 
 
(b)  
Interest; 
 
(c)  
Land; 
 
(d)  
Permanent Building; 
 
(e)  
Entertainment; 
 
(f)  
Contributions or donations; 
 
(g)  
Fines, legal expenses and penalties; 
 
(h)  
Advocacy and business development; 
 
(j)  
Losses on other contracts; 
 
(k)  
Alcoholic beverages; and 
 
(l)  
Business organisation costs such as costs of incorporation, re-organisation and 
merger. 
 
9. 
A cost shall not be presumed to be allowable merely because the DA actually incurred 
the costs, unless meets the test of relevancy, financial prudence, reasonability and 
relationship.  
 
10. 
Allocability of the Cost.  
A cost is allocable if it is assignable or chargeable to 
one or more cost objectives on the basis of relative benefits received or other equitable 
relationship. Subject to the foregoing, a cost is allocable to a Government contract if it: (a) is 
incurred specifically for the contract; (b) benefits both the contract and other work and can be 
distributed to them in reasonable proportion to the benefits received; and (c) is necessary to 
the overall operation of the business, although a direct relationship to any particular cost 
objective cannot be shown. In any case, indirect costs shall not exceed 10% of the total 
approved cost for prototype development.  
 
11.  
A cost is reasonable if it would have been incurred by prudent entity in the conduct of 
competitive business. To be reasonable, the cost must be: (i) generally recognised as an 
ordinary or necessary cost of business; (ii) follow sound business practices; (iii) comply with 

367 
 
Central, State, local laws; and (iv) be consistent with the Development Agency’s established 
business practices. The determination of reasonableness of a particular cost shall depend on 
all relevant facts and circumstances concerning the costs; and the decision of the Ministry of 
Defence in this regard shall be final. If there is any change in the Indian Accounting Standard 
7, the changes will be suitably incorporated in the DAP by Acquisition Wing, in consultation 
with MoD (Fin).   
 
12.  
The Development Agency shall submit a break-up of cost estimates for each stage 
outlined at Appendix D to Chapter III. These stages shall also form specific potential exit 
points for the Ministry of Defence without any further liability, if the Ministry of Defence is 
of the considered opinion that requisite and timely progress has not been made by the DA for 
successful completion of that phase.  
 
13. 
The Ministry of Defence shall not, under any circumstances, entertain or consider any 
revisions, submissions or arguments for inclusion of un-allowable costs as specified in these 
Guidelines.

generated under contract; and the contractor retains title or ownership and all other rights in 
intellectual property that are not granted to the Government, subject to conditions prescribed 
herein.  
 
2. 
During the development of prototype, if any technology/product is developed, which 
the Government considers to be sensitive or classified and needs to be restricted for use in 
other purposes or for export, the Government through PFT or any other expert or body may 
identify such technology/product. The provisions for IPRs in respect of such 
technology/product will be separately negotiated in compliance with the laws and regulations 
on the subject. 
 
3. 
All technology licensing is divided up between two mutually exclusive categories of 
deliverables:  
 
(a) 
Technical Data (TD)2; and

disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the 
software to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or 
its assets to another party;  
 
10. 
For the purposes of these guidelines, “Government Purpose” means an activity in 
which the Government of India is a party, including cooperative agreements with 
international or multi-national defence organisations, or sales or transfers by the Government 
of India to foreign Government or international organisations. Government purposes include 
competitive procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, 
perform, display, or disclose technical data for commercial purposes or authorise others to do 
so. 11. In addition to standard GPRs, Government rights in computer software to be delivered 
under contract shall also include the right to:-  
 
(a)  
Use of a computer program with government computer(s);

March-In Rights 
 
11. 
The Government shall have “March-In” rights for all items covered under its 
“Government-Purpose Rights”. “March-In” Rights shall include the right to work the patent, 
either by itself, or by another entity on behalf of the Government, in case the contractor fails 
to work the patent on its own within a specified and reasonable period of time.  
 
12. 
Under its march-in rights, the Government can require the contractor to grant, or may 
itself grant license for, inter alia, the following reasons: -  
 
(a) 
The contractor fails to work the patent towards practical application within a 
reasonable time; or  
 
(b) 
Where health and safety requirements so require the Government to act in 
public interest; or  
 
(c) 
For National Security Reasons; or  
 
(d) 
To meet requirements for public use not reasonably satisfied by the contractor; 
or  
 
(e) 
For failure of the contractor to substantially manufacture the products 
embodying the subject invention in India; or  
 
(f) 
For failure of the contractor to comply with any of the requirements laid down 
under these guidelines. 
 
Miscellaneous. 
 
13. 
The contractor is required to have a timely and efficient disclosure system in place for 
reporting of intellectual property generation under the “Make” contract to the Ministry of 
Defence. Failure to disclose in timely manner, or failure on part of the contractor to invoke 
his/her default right of ownership, shall imply that all IPRs shall ab-initio vest in the 
Government of India. The contractor may elect to retain title of any invention made in the 
performance of work under a contract. If the contractor does not elect to retain title, the title 
shall ab-initio vest in the Government as stared above and the contractor shall only be entitled 

372 
 
to a license on such terms and conditions that the Government may deem it fit. Such license 
to the contractor shall usually be (a) revocable, non-exclusive and royalty-free; (b) extend to 
its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates; and (c) include the right to sublicense; but (d) shall 
not be transferable without prior approval of the Government.  
 
14. 
The contractor shall also be required to submit periodic reports about 
commercialization and manufacturing activities undertaken for products embodying the 
subject invention under “Make” contracts.  
 
15. 
The Government’s IPRs shall flow down from the prime contractor to all sub-
contractors at all tiers; that is, every sub-contractor will have the same obligations vis-à-vis 
the Government as applicable to the prime contractor under the main procurement contract. 
To this end, the sub-contractors shall have limited contractual privity with the Government 
solely for the purposes of their IPR obligations to the Government.  
 
16. 
The ownership of any rights by the contractor does not include an absolute right to 
transfer of any software, product or documentation; and such transfer, including export 
thereof, shall continue to be governed by and be subject to the Export Policy, Export 
Guidelines and all applicable laws, rules, regulations, orders and instructions of the 
Government of India. All such transfers and exports shall require prior and explicit approval 
of the Ministry of Defence.  
 
17.  
Where the DA is not a consortium, ownership rights in intellectual property being 
generated under the “Make” contract shall vest with the Government upon dissolution of such 
DA. Where the DA is a consortium, the ownership rights in the IP generated under the 
“Make” contract, upon dissolution of the consortium, shall vest amongst the partners as per 
their agreement on the subject contained in the joint partnership agreement of the consortium, 
without government rights as licensee being adversely affected in any manner.

PROCEDURE FOR ACQUISITION OF 
SYSTEMS DESIGNED AND 
DEVELOPED BY DRDO /DPSU /OFB 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

375 
 
CHAPTER IV 
 
PROCEDURE FOR ACQUISITION OF SYSTEMS DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED 
BY DRDO/DPSU/OFB 
 
 
Background 
 
1. 
The aim of this procedure is to enable acquisition and induction of equipment/ system 
developed by DRDO/DPSU/OFB into the Services. This process will help not only in 
translating the existing indigenous technological capability into systems, but also in 
implementing ‘Make in India’ with indigenous technology through Indian industry. This 
Chapter describes the procedure for Design and Development of equipment/ systems by 
DRDO/DPSU/OFB in detail which will lead to subsequent induction. The procedure covers 
the development of systems from inception till induction by Services and Life Cycle Support, 
as per flow chart given at Appendix A to this Chapter. 
 
2. 
While technology levels in Defence Systems in the country have reached global 
standards in a number of areas, however, in other areas we may need to follow a Spiral 
Development Model to keep pace with the international standards. Moreover, technology is 
ever-changing; and to constantly remain at par with global technologies, indigenous 
technology development must continue, through Spiral Development, if required. Spiral 
Development Model is proposed to be adopted for indigenous capability building, wherever 
considered essential and feasible keeping Operational Requirement of Services in mind. 
 
Development and Acquisition Process 
 
3. 
On the basis of Operational Requirements (ORs)/Integrated Capability Development 
Plan (ICDP), SHQ shall identify the equipment/platform which could be undertaken for 
Design and Development (D&D) by DRDO/DPSU/OFB for subsequent induction. All such 
cases would be categorised as ‘Buy (Indian-IDDM)’ for subsequent procurement from the 
industry partner of DRDO or DPSU/OFB. DRDO would select Development cum Production 
Partner(s) (DcPP(s)) whereas in case of DPSU/OFB, the entire D&D and subsequent 
production may be undertaken by themselves. In certain cases, DRDO/DPSU/OFB may also 
nominate a PA from Indian industry. 
 
4. 
The 
acquisition 
process 
for 
the 
systems 
Designed 
and 
Developed 
by 
DRDO/DPSU/OFB would involve the following functions: - 
 
 
(a) 
Initiation of D&D case by SHQ. 
 
 
(b) 
Accord of Acceptance of Necessity (AoN). 
 
 
 

376 
 
 
 
(c) 
Design and Development. 
 
(i) 
Identification of Development cum Production Partner(s) by 
DRDO/DPSU/OFB. 
 
 
 
 
(ii) 
Detailed Design Review (DDR) along with SHQ representatives. 
 
(iii) 
Critical Design Review (CDR) by DRDO/DPSU/OFB and SHQ. 
 
(iv)      Issue of Trial Directive by SHQ. 
 
(v) 
Realisation of prototype. 
 
(vi) 
PSQR Validation Trials, based on Trial Directive, by SHQ nominated 
Trial Team. 
 
(d) 
Staff Evaluation. 
 
 
 
(e) 
Conversion of PSQRs into SQRs. 
 
(f) 
Issue of Commercial Request for Proposal (RFP) to DcPP(s)/ Production 
Agency(ies) - PA(s) of DRDO/ DPSU/OFB. 
 
 
(g) 
Commercial negotiations by Contract Negotiation Committee (CNC). 
 
 
(h) 
Approval of the Competent Financial Authority (CFA). 
 
 
(j) 
Award of contract/ Supply Order (SO). 
 
 
(k) 
Contract Administration and Post-Contract Management. 
 
Initiation of D&D Case by SHQ 
 
5. 
The Statement of Case (SoC) would be initiated by the concerned SHQ in 
consultation with DRDO/DPSU/OFB and circulated to all concerned stakeholders, for 
comments. 
 
6. 
The SoC for seeking AoN shall, inter-alia, include the Feasibility Study report, 
PSQRs, MOQ, and a broad Trial Methodology. The Feasibility Study report will be 
undertaken by DRDO/DPSU/OFB with requisite inputs of Sponsor SHQ. Feasibility study 
will jointly define MOQ and recommend the number of DcPP (s). 
 
 
 

377 
 
 
 
7. 
The SoC for seeking AoN will, inter alia, highlight the following: - 
 
 
(a) 
Recommended level of Indigenous Content. 
 
(b) 
Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) which can be exclusively committed, 
keeping in mind the financial viability of the identified project at production stage 
after the successful development of prototype, within the specified development 
timeline. In case, SHQ have opted for multi-stage PSQRs for Spiral Development, 
SoC shall separately list out MOQ for each stage. Since, the AoN is being obtained 
based on MOQ, there would be no requirement of scaling & quantity vetting at AoN 
stage, but the basis of MOQ will be included in the SoC. 
 
(c) 
If the prototype is not developed within the agreed timeline, SHQ may acquire 
the weapon/equipment/platform through other procurement categories/procedures 
with approval of AoN according authority. 
 
(d) 
Envisaged development timelines for prototype. 
 
(e) 
Estimated development cost of project. 
 
(f) 
Estimated production cost of orders for subsequent procurement under Buy 
(Indian-IDDM) category. 
 
(g) 
 Provision of multiple DcPP(s) and division of ordered quantity among 
successful DcPP(s), where applicable. In case of multiple DcPP(s), their respective 
prototypes would be trial evaluated, as applicable. 
 
 
8. 
PSQRs will be formulated by SHQ in consultation DRDO/DPSU/OFB specifying 
essential and desirable parameters. The applicability of Spiral Development would also be 
considered during the PSQR formulation itself. 
 
9 
Along with the PSQRs, a trial methodology to quantify and verify each PSQR 
parameter should be finalized. 
 
Accord of Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) 
 
10. 
After incorporating the comments on the SoC, as feasible, SHQ shall field the case in 
SPB/DPB/DAC, as applicable, for accord of AoN. 
 
11. 
DcPP(s)/ PA (s) identified by DRDO shall not be considered as a Single Vendor Case 
(SVC). Similarly, if the D&D is by DPSU/OFB without any DcPP, it would not be treated as 
SVC. 
 

378 
 
 
 
12. 
Validity of AoN for D&D projects by DRDO/DPSU/OFB will be six months from the 
date of approval of SQRs by relevant SEPC. 
 
 
13. 
Cases for Ex-post-facto AoN. 
For on-going cases, where the development had 
commenced prior to accord of AoN, ex-post facto approval may be accorded by the DAC. 
 
Design and Development 
 
14. 
Design and Development would be undertaken as per DRDO/DPSU/OFB procedures. 
The major activities to be carried out during D&D are described in the following paragraphs. 
 
Development cum Production Partner (s) 
 
15. 
The feasibility study will recommend the number of DcPP(s) to be selected based on 
the quantities required, complexities of the technology, risk mitigation, expertise available 
within the Indian industry etc. DcPP will be selected as per definition of Indian Vendor given 
at Paragraph 20 including sub Paragraph 20(a) and 20(b) of Chapter I. Efforts should be to 
have more than one DcPP. If only one DcPP is recommended, DRDO will justify the same to 
AoN according authority. 
 
16. DRDO shall select DcPP(s) during the initial stages of development as per DRDO 
procedures.  In case during selection through competitive mode results into a single DcPP 
during the development phase, the same will not be treated as a Single Vendor Case and 
progressed thereafter. In case of D&D by DPSU/OFB, there may not be any DcPP; however, 
in case, there is a DcPP, provisions as applicable to DRDO will apply. 
 
17. 
In certain cases, where the quantities are limited and production by industry is not 
feasible, production can be undertaken by DRDO/DPSU/OFB with approval of AoN 
according authority.  DRDO will however identify a suitable maintenance agency as per its 
internal procedures to provide Life Cycle Support for the equipment. In such cases, if the 
production is undertaken by DRDO, it will be based on Indent/Project Sanction Order and 
thus the costing will be as per internal procedures of DRDO and budget for limited quantity 
produced will be as per procedures of Capital Acquisition. However, if the production is 
being undertaken by DPSU/OFB, costing may be done by a Costing Committee constituted 
by DDP. 
 
Review and Monitoring  
 
18. 
The Detailed Design Review (DDR) and Critical Design Review (CDR) would be 
conducted as per internal procedures of Design Agency jointly with SHQ. Project reviews 
would also be done as per internal procedure to assess the progress and suggest corrective 
measures, if any. 
 

379 
 
 
 
19. 
Joint Project Monitoring Team(JPMT).  DRDO/DPSU/OFB will constitute a 
Joint Project Monitoring Team which will be chaired by a two-star/one-star officer from the 
concerned SHQ and co-chaired by a Project Director/ Deputy Project Director of the Nodal 
Lab of DRDO/ GM Level officer in case of DPSU/OFB. JPMT will have representatives 
from Design Agency i.e. DRDO/DPSU/OFB, MoD(Acquisition), DGQA/DGAQA/DGNAI, 
representatives from Maintenance Branch, as required and other experts if considered 
necessary.  Domain experts, if considered necessary may also be included.  The suggested 
constitution and role of JPMT is described in Appendix B. 
 
20. 
Project Management Team(PMT).    In addition to JPMT, the SHQ will affiliate a 
PMT to the project. PMT will be a subset of JPMT. Based on the cost and complexity of the 
project, a dedicated PMT will be constituted which will be co-located with the project. The 
PMT will comprise of associated officer representative of User Directorate from SHQ with 
requisite support staff including a Quality Assurance specialist, if required. The officer 
representative of PMT would attend all meetings of JPMT. The PMT will function in close 
coordination with the project team with respect to monitoring, assisting in availability of 
Service resources in terms of ranges, platforms or earmarking of specific units/sub-units of 
Services. The PMT will also address day-to-day user requirements and seek directions from 
SHQ on complex issues. It will give periodic updates to JPMT and SHQ. The role of PMT is 
described in Appendix B. 
 
21. 
Apex Level Review. The Apex Level Review will be carried out by Apex Board for 
DRDO and by BRMC for DPSU/OFB, as applicable. 
 
(a)     Apex Board (AB).   Bi-annual Review and Monitoring of all AoN accorded

Issue of Trial Directive 
 
22. 
Trial Directive will be issued by SHQ in consultation with JPMT and PMT after 
completion of the Critical Design Review (CDR). 
 
23. 
The Trial Directive will be formulated by the SHQ in consultation with Design 
Agency and must specify the fundamental points that need to be addressed for validating the 
‘Essential’ parameters, along with EMI/EMC, Maintenance and Quality requirements. Trial 
Directive will be issued on the basis of Trial Methodology. Certain members of PMT will be 
included in the Trial Team constituted by SHQ for conduct of trials. CoC submitted by 
Design Agency duly recommended by JPMT will be taken into account while formulating the 
Trial Directive.   
 
Realisation of Prototype  
 
24. 
Prototype shall be realized by the DcPP(s)/ PA(s) in case of design by DRDO; and by 
DPSU/OFB in case no DcPP/PA is engaged by them.  
 
25. 
Prototype Development Stage. 
Design Agency, in close consultation with PMT 
would initially carry out in-house/ internal testing & evaluation to validate the performance 
of the sub-systems/ sub-assemblies against the PSQR parameters. During this stage, if some 
parameters of sub-systems/sub-assemblies are evaluated as per Quality Testing(QT) & 
Acceptance Testing (AT) or through accredited test labs/physical trials aligned with Trial 
Directive, SHQ/ DGQA/DGAQA/DGNAI, as applicable, shall  accept the Certificate of 
Conformance (CoC) for such parameters as submitted by the Design Agency.  
 
Trials & Evaluation 
 
26. 
The multi stage trials of UATT / FET would be integrated into single stage 
progressive trials in order to ensure timely procurement subject to the DcPP(s) realizing the 
prototype for PSQR Validation Trials with absorption of technology. In case, where PA is 
incorporated post development of prototype, then PSQR Validation Trials would be 
conducted on Design Agency prototypes to freeze PSQRs to SQRs and subsequently SHQ 
may conduct Field Evaluation Trials on PA produced prototypes, in order to validate only 
critical parameters of SQRs and absorption of technology. 
 
27. 
PSQR Validation Trials. 
PSQR Validation Trials shall be conducted by SHQ & 
Design Agency in consultation with JPMT and PMT to validate the PSQRs and enable their 
conversion to SQRs. The trials will be conducted as per approved Trial Directive and within 
specified defined timelines laid down in Trial Directive. SHQ will formulate a SOP for 
conduct of PSQR Validation Trials and share the same with DRDO. 
 
28. 
In case the PSQR Validation Trials conducted on the final integrated prototypes 
produced by the DcPP(s) are successful, no further Field Evaluation Trials are necessary. In 

381 
 
 
 
case of prototype not achieving PSQRs fully, SHQ may consider Spiral Development if 
acceptable and convert achieved PSQRs to SQRs for only a Limited Series Production, to be 
approved by BRMC/AB and informed to AoN according authority. However, in case 
prototype does not meet critical parameters as acceptable to SHQ, the JPMT will take 
necessary decisions for either continuation of further development or recommend foreclosure 
of the project to BRMC/AB.    
 
29. 
In this regard, also refer to Paragraphs 65, 66, 68, 69, 74, 75, 76, and 77 of Chapter II 
of DAP 2020 regarding acceptance of vendor certification, certifications from accredited 
labs, simulated tests etc which may be especially applied for conditions/parameters not 
related to primary employment of the equipment.  
 
30. 
The following documents should be made available to Trial Agencies, at the start of 
PSQR Validation Trials: - 
 
 
(a) 
Requisite technical documentation. 
 
 
(b) 
Draft maintenance manuals. 
 
 
(c) 
List of components/ parts (for Maintainability Equipment Trials). 
 
 
 
(d) 
List of Certificates of Conformance (CoC) and certifications from accredited 
labs, if any. 
 
Staff Evaluation 
 
31. 
Staff Evaluation report based on PSQR Validation Trials will be accepted at the SHQ 
by the CISC/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DG ICG. 
 
32. 
Staff Evaluation may also recommend ‘Limited Validation Trials’ (LVT)/First Off 
Production Model (FOPM) trials, if required. Both LVT and FOPM trials shall address only 
parameters considered essential by SHQ. In cases where DcPP was not involved in the D&D 
process, Staff Evaluation may recommend Field Evaluation Trials of prototypes to be 
manufactured by the DRDO nominated Production agencies (PA(s)). The evaluation report 
will then again be processed for acceptance by the CISC/VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/DG ICG. 
 
Freezing of PSQRs (Conversion into SQRs) 
 
33. 
After successful completion of PSQR Validation Trials, PSQRs shall be converted 
into SQRs and approved by the relevant SEPC within eight to ten weeks of receipt of Trial 
Report. 
 
 
 

382 
 
 
 
Issue of Commercial Request for Proposal (RFP) 
 
34. 
For better price discovery, commercial RFP would be issued on conversion of PSQRs 
to SQRs. 
 
35. 
RFP, besides seeking commercial inputs will also seek costing details for Life Cycle 
Support. Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP) will be jointly formulated by Design Agency, 
SHQ, DGQA/DGAQA/DGNAI and DCPP/PA concurrently to trials and included in the 
commercial RFP. Certification of IC content will be submitted by the vendor as per Annexure 
II to Appendix B of Chapter I of DAP 2020. 
 
Commercial Negotiations  
 
36. 
Commercial negotiations by Contract Negotiation Committee (CNC) and stages 
thereafter would be progressed as per provisions of DAP-2020. However, to expedite the 
acquisition process; all activities including benchmarking less opening of commercial bid 
may be undertaken post successful completion of trials, prior to acceptance of Staff 
Evaluation. Representative of DRDO shall be included in the Benchmarking Model 
Committee. 
 
37. 
In cases where procurement is undertaken from OFB/DPSU and in Single Vendor 
Cases, on recommendation of Cost Negotiation Committee, a Costing Committee will be 
constituted by DDP to carry out pricing of the equipment. 
 
38.     Post the approval of the CFA, contract for supply of equipment/platform shall be 
awarded to DcPP/PA. Post contract management will be as per Chapter XI of DAP 2020.

CHAPTER V 
 
FAST TRACK PROCEDURE (FTP) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

388 
 
CHAPTER V 
 
FAST TRACK PROCEDURE (FTP) 
 
1. 
The aim of the FTP, outlined in the succeeding paragraphs is to ensure expeditious 
procurement for urgent operational requirements of the Armed Forces, foreseen as imminent 
during war as well as peace time and for situations in which crisis emerges without prior 
warning. FTP may also be applied for cases where timelines of the normal prescribed 
procedure in procuring of operationally critical equipment is seen to be adversely impacting 
the capability and operational preparedness of the Armed Forces.  
 
 
 
Scope 
 
2. 
The FTP will cover acquisitions under ‘Buy’ category or outright purchase. The 
acquisitions may or may not be part of ICDP/DCAP/AAP. Such acquisitions are applicable 
for both indigenous sources and ex-import. Procurement proposals in which FET/limited 
validation trials are envisaged, will not be progressed under the purview of FTP. 
 
3. 
The acquisition under FTP can be categorised as under: - 
 
(a) 
Procurement of equipment already inducted into Service.  
 
(b) 
Procurement of new equipment. 
 
(c) 
Procurement of weapon systems/platforms, which are/were in service in a 
foreign country and available for transfer/lease or sale (ex-stock or fresh production). 
 
Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) 
 
4. 
Adoption of FTP will be approved by DAC based on proposals by respective SHQ 
with approval of the concerned Service Chiefs. The projected requirement must be related to 
an operational situation foreseen as imminent or for a situation where a crisis has emerged 
without prior warning. It may also be applied for cases where timelines of the normal 
prescribed procedure in procuring of operationally critical equipment is seen to be adversely 
impacting the capability and operational preparedness of the Armed Forces or where 
undue/unforced delays are adversely impacting the capacity and the preparedness of the 
Armed Forces. The requirement, as projected, must identify the items required, their numbers 
as per Quantity Vetting approved, mode of procurement, broad Operational Requirements 
(ORs)/Services Qualitative Requirements (SQRs) desired/OEM defined specifications which 
meet the operational needs of the Service concerned and the time-frame within which they 
need to be inducted.  
 
5. 
AoN for Procurement of Technical Intelligence (TECHINT) Equipment/Systems. 
Procurement of TECHINT equipment/systems will follow the FTP route. Procurement of 

389 
 
equipment/systems with estimated cost of Single System more than ₹ 15 crores and Multiple 
Systems more than ₹ 30 crores, will be approved by the Technical Coordination Group at the 
National Security Council Secretariat, as per guidelines promulgated by the Cabinet 
Committee on Security dated 13 October 2016, and as amended from time to time. AoN for 
the same will be granted by AoN according authority as per delegated powers. Procurements 
below these estimated costs will be accorded AoN by the delegated CFA in consultation with 
the Integrated Financial Advisor as per Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) promulgated by 
SHQ.  
 
6. 
Splitting Source of Supply.  
In cases, where it is decided in advance to have 
more than one source of supply to facilitate expeditious procurement, specific approval for 
ratio of splitting the supply between L1, L2 and L3 vendors will be taken in the AoN. 
Splitting of the supply will only be done provided L2 and L3 vendors are ready to accept the 
price and terms and conditions quoted by/negotiated with the L1 vendor and the same will be 
pre disclosed in the RFP. 
 
7. 
Statement of Case (SoC). 
The format for SoC for processing proposals for FTP 
cases is given as Appendix A to Chapter V. Consequent to the initiation of the proposal, the 
DAC would discuss the proposal and accord Acceptance of Necessity to the proposal. 
Decisions on following aspects will be explicitly approved by the DAC: - 
 
(a) 
Equipment and the quantities. 
 
(b) 
Source of Procurement. 
 
(i) 
Vendor Whose Equipment is Already in Service. For equipment 
already inducted into service, it may be necessary to go back to the OEM for 
procurement of additional equipment/major-assemblies/sub-assemblies/Special 
Maintenance Tools (SMTs)/Special Test Equipment (STE) or Maintenance or 
integration of Buyer Furnished Equipment (BFE), as no other supplier would be 
in a position to meet these requirements. All such acquisitions would not be 
construed as single vendor cases and no waiver will be required. It must, 
however, be ensured that when spares etc are procured from OEMs of 
subassemblies, the assurances/warranties extended by the OEM for the main 
equipment retain their validity. Confirmation should be obtained, by 
telefax/email, that the proposed vendor is in a position to supply the required 
quantities in the proposed time frame. Such cases could be for: - 
 
 
(aa) 
Additional quantities of an ongoing contract. 
 
(ab) 
Invoking ‘Option Clause’.       In case the quantities required 
are in excess of the ‘Option Clause’ of the contract up to a maximum of 
100% of the previous contract, the same would need to be approved by 

390 
 
the DAC. 
 
(ac) 
Repeat Orders for Previous Contracts.        Quantities could 
be more than100% of the original contract. 
 
(ad) 
Case where the previous supplier is not able to supply the entire 
quantity of required item, procurement may be made from other known 
vendors whose equipment has been found acceptable in the past. 
 
(ii) 
Procurement of a New Equipment based on:- 
 
 
(aa) 
Single vendor. 
 
(ab) 
Multi-vendor. 
 
(iii) 
Procurement from any foreign country, in-service/previously in-service 
equipment available for transfer/lease or sale (ex stock or fresh production).  
 
(c) 
Approval required for witnessing demonstrations of compliance to Service 
Qualitative Requirement (SQRs) or Operational Requirements (ORs) or OEM defined 
specifications which meet the operational needs/capacity verification. 
 
(d) 
Estimated cost of the proposal. 
 
(e) 
Time schedule for induction to be specified by the DAC. 
 
8. 
Based on the AoN granted by the DAC, the SHQ would initiate the procurement 
process and progress as per procedure applicable for the non-delegated/delegated cases. 
 
9. 
Given the limited time-frame, FTP would be restricted to such equipment as would be 
available within the specified time-frames and therefore, long lead items such as major 
weapon systems should be avoided. The items involved should preferably be such, which are 
already in Service or have been trial evaluated or is in service in foreign defence forces or are 
available widely in the world/indigenous market for ready procurement, so that the time 
required for evaluation is minimised. Indian Ambassadors/Defence Attaches(DAs) in their 
respective country would confirm the information furnished by the vendors regarding the 
item being ‘In Service’ in foreign Defence Forces/foreign Law Enforcement Agencies. The 
TEC would include such information received from Ambassadors/DAs in their technical 
compliance statement. 
 
Procurement of Equipment Already Inducted into Service 
 
10. 
There may be a situation where the vendor who has supplied the equipment earlier is 
unable to supply the required quantity within the given time frame. In order not to proliferate 
the existing inventory, MoD (Acquisition)/SHQ will first invite commercial offer from the 

391 
 
vendor and negotiate the price based on the LPP. Thereafter, MoD (Acquisition)/SHQ will 
invite all vendors (as approved by the DAC), whose equipment have been trial evaluated and 
found acceptable for introduction into Service, for supply of the balance quantity of 
equipment at the negotiated price with the last supplier. Apportionment of quantity would be 
as per the earlier L2, L3, in that order. 
 
Procurement of New Equipment 
 
11. 
Service Qualitative Requirements (SQR)/Operational Requirement (ORs)/OEM 
Defined Specifications Which Meet Operational Needs.      For procurement of new 
equipment, there would be a requirement of formulation of Service Qualitative Requirement 
(SQRs) or Operational Requirements (ORs) or OEM defined specifications which meet the 
operational needs, by the concerned Service HQs. While formulating the SQRs/ORs, it would 
be kept in mind that the required equipment is already in Service or has been trial evaluated 
or is in service in foreign defence forces or is available widely in the world/indigenous 
market for ready procurement. Such SQRs/ORs/ OEM defined specifications which meet the 
operational needs, could be approved by appropriate authority at Service HQs and may be 
without endorsement by Staff Equipment Policy Committee. The SQRs/ORs/ OEM defined 
specifications which meet the operational needs would be forwarded along with the proposal 
after approval of the Service Chief. 
 
12. 
Solicitation of Offers. 
Solicitation of offers will be as per ‘Single Stage-Two 
Bid System’. RFPs will be processed by SHQs within 10 days of accord of AoN. In order to 
save time, collegiate vetting of RFP and shortlisting of vendors will be resorted to at 
MoD/SHQs. RFP will be approved by DG (Acquisition)/CISC/Vice Chiefs/DGICG and 
issued by ADGs Acquisition Technical. A copy of the RFP may be digitally transmitted to 
Vendors in order to save on time. In FTP cases based on IGA/Government to Government 
(G2G) Agreements etc, LoR/Memorandum/LoI will be issued by respective AMs/SHQs as 
applicable based on delegated powers. 
 
13. 
Request for Proposal (RFP). 
 The RFP will be a self-contained document that 
will enable vendors to make their offers after consideration of full requirement of the 
acquisition. The standardised RFP document under FTP would be as per Schedule I to 
Chapter II with relevant modifications/amendments.  
 
14. 
Technical Evaluation.    The Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) will carry out 
evaluation of the technical bids received in response to RFP, with reference to 
SQRs/ORs/OEM defined specifications which meet the operational needs. It will examine the 
extent of variations/differences, if any, in the technical characteristics of the equipment 
offered by various vendors with reference to the SQRs/ORs and prepare a compliance 
statement, short listing the equipment acceptable for procurement. In all FTP cases, approval 
of the TEC shall be done within the SHQ. However, where any vendor(s) is found non-
compliant at the TEC stage in non-delegated cases, approval of DG (Acquisition) will be 
obtained, through respective ADGs Acquisition Technical, prior to progressing the case 

392 
 
further.  
 
15. 
Benchmark Models Committee.     Benchmarking would be carried out within a 
week of acceptance of TEC Report by DG (Acquisition)/CISC/Vice Chiefs/DGICG, by a 
Benchmark Models Committee headed by the Advisor (Cost)/Director (Cost) for non-
delegated and delegated cases respectively, and representatives of concerned SHQ 
Directorates. This process will be automatically undertaken once SHQ informs Advisor 
(Cost)/Director (Cost) about acceptance of the TEC Report. Along with this information, 
SHQ will also provide Advisor (Cost)/Director (Cost) with details of representatives of SHQ 
Directorates nominated as members of the concerned Benchmark Models Committee. The 
recommendations of the Benchmark Models Committee may be accepted as such/deliberated 
upon by the CNC. Till then, the benchmark models and costing data prepared by the 
Benchmark Models Committee will be kept in a sealed cover with the Chairman of the CNC 
as applicable.  
 
16. 
Empowered Committee.  Although there would be no requirement of any trial 
evaluation of the identified equipment, an Empowered Committee may be authorised to visit 
the premises of vendors to witness demonstrations/evaluate the equipment as required. The 
Empowered Committee may be authorised by DAC to negotiate and conclude contracts in the 
shortest possible time and would have adequate representations from different wings of the 
MoD/SHQs to ensure that requisite expertise and authority for procurement action is 
available. 
The 
Empowered 
Committee 
Report 
will 
be 
accepted 
by 
DG(Acquisition)/authorised PSO in the SHQ for the non-delegated/ delegated powers 
respectively. There will be no GS evaluation in FTP cases. In case the Empowered 
Committee is not empowered to negotiate and conclude the contract, CNC may be constituted 
on receipt of the Report of such Empowered Committee. 
 
17. 
Contract Negotiation Committee (CNC). CNC would be conducted as per 
provisions given out in Chapter II. 
 
18. 
Oversight Committee. 
For non-delegated power cases, a committee chaired by 
an Additional Secretary level officer of the Department of Defence (DoD) with members; i.e. 
one Major General/equivalent officer from Services(other than lead agency), one JS level 
officer from Department of Military Affairs (DMA)and one representative of MoD (Fin) 
nominated by Secretary (Defence Finance) /Financial Advisor (Defence Services)  will check 
whether the process of FTP has been followed as per DAP and bring out deviations, if any. 
The committee will also review and bring out the status of grievances or complaints in the 
case. The Committee will submit the report to Defence Secretary for acceptance, within 10 
days of its constitution.  
 
19. 
Contract Conclusion. 
The contract will be signed after the CFA approval of 
the case. Provisions with regard to Contract conclusion will be as per provisions given out in 
Chapter II. In addition, the contract should specify the date by which the vendor would have 
to submit BGs, as also the date by which MoD would have to open the Letter of Credits. The 

393 
 
Standard Contract Document as in Chapter VI of the DAP would provide the guidelines for 
acquisitions under FTP. Any deviations to the standard contractual clauses would be accorded 
by the CFA, based on recommendations of the CNC/Empowered Committee. In FTP cases 
based on IGA/G2G etc, Contract/LoA will be signed by respective AMs/SHQs as applicable 
based on delegated powers. 
 
Additional Provisions 
 
20. 
In case of procurement from a Defence Public Sector Undertaking (DPSU), a Letter 
of Intent (LoI) may be placed immediately on the DPSU which supplied this store last or is 
having a running contract. The details concerning prices would be negotiated and 
incorporated in a contract subsequently. 
 
21. 
In case of procurement from OFB, for an already introduced item, indent would be 
placed by SHQ after AoN has been accorded. 
 
22. 
In certain acquisition cases, it may be expedient to procure equipment from foreign 
countries by sale/transfer/lease/otherwise ex their own stocks. In such cases, G2G 
Agreements at appropriate level would be established to facilitate the issue of such stores. 
However, it would be ensured that adequate residual shelf life remains available for the 
Armed Forces. In such cases, a technical delegation may be sent to check the condition of the 
equipment being offered as required. Only if it is technically acceptable, would the case be 
processed further. 
 
23. 
Inspection. 
Considering the urgent nature of requirements and to ensure that items 
being supplied conform to the technical specifications agreed to in the contract, Pre Dispatch 
Inspection (PDI) of the stores needs to be carried out by the Buyer’s QA agency at the 
premises of the vendor, wherever considered necessary by the SHQ. If PDI is not to be 
carried out, then the vendor will furnish his own Certificate of Quality or of the Defence 
Forces of his country or of its accredited quality assurance agency. In such cases, Joint 
Receipt and Inspection (JRI) would be carried out by the MoD and the vendor in India. In 
such cases, certain sums from those due for payment to the vendor would be retained to be 
released only on successful completion of JRI. In case of items procured through G2G 
agreements signed at appropriate level, PDI may not be insisted upon and their Certificate of 
Quality may be considered for acceptance. 
 
24. 
Performance cum Warranty Bank Guarantee (PWBG). PWBG @ 10% of the 
Contract Price, from any Indian Public or Private Scheduled Commercial Bank or First Class 
banks of international repute will be submitted by the vendor(s). 
 
25. 
Liquidated Damages (LD).         In case of delay in supplies, the vendor shall be 
levied LD @ 1.5% per week of delay subject to maximum of 15% of value of delayed stores, 
calculated on the basis of the Contract Price of delayed stores. 
 

394 
 
26. 
Termination Clause. The Termination Clause in FTP cases will be applicable in the 
following cases: - 
 
(a) 
The delivery of the equipment is delayed for causes not attributable to Force 
Majeure for more than six months after the scheduled date of delivery. 
 
(b) 
The Seller is declared bankrupt or becomes insolvent. 
 
(c) 
The ‘Buyer’ has noticed that the seller has utilised the services of an Agent in 
getting this contract and paid any commission to such individual/company etc. 
 
27. 
In case of supplies from countries with which Bi-lateral Agreement exists for 
Standard Terms & Agreements of Contract, the same would supersede the corresponding 
terms & conditions of the Standard Contract Document. 
 
28. 
Since the procurement under FTP would be for cases of urgent operational 
requirements, it is imperative that all activities be carried out in a time-bound manner. The 
proposed time frame for each activity is given at Appendix B to Chapter V. In case it takes 
more than six months to conclude the contract or time in excess of the schedule indicated by 
the DAC for induction of the equipment, the proposal/case would be referred back to the 
DAC for appropriate directions. 
 
29. 
While the above provisions are adopted as the guidelines for emergency procurement, 
it may not always be possible to ensure complete compliance of above conditions. In such 
cases, specific approval seeking waiver would be obtained from the Raksha Mantri. 
 
Monitoring 
 
30. 
The concerned SHQ would monitor the receipt and ensure expeditious induction of 
stores subsequent to delivery of items. While responsibility for contract administration and 
management would be that of the SHQ concerned, post-contract monitoring would be 
conducted by the MoD (Acquisition). The projects would be reviewed by the Acquisition 
Manager/equivalent Service Officer in the respective SHQ.

CHAPTER VII 
 
REVITALISING DEFENCE INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM 
THROUGH STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS 
 
Preamble 
 
1.        The  production  of  major  defence  platforms  and  equipment  such  as  aircraft,  
submarines, helicopters and armoured vehicles in India are currently carried out by Defence 
Public Sector Undertakings (DPSU) and the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB). Though defence 
manufacturing has been open to private sector participation for well over a decade, private 
companies have pointed to the lack of a level playing field compared to DPSUs and 
Ordnance Factories (OFs), which continue to enjoy a commanding role based on various 
forms of governmental support over the past decades, including long - term purchase 
arrangements.   There is thus a need to institutionalise a transparent, objective and functional 
mechanism to encourage broader participation of the private sector, in addition to capacities 
of DPSUs/OFB, in manufacturing of major defence platforms. Expert Committees set up by 
Ministry of Defence (MoD) provided a detailed road map for development of defence 
industrial base through the ‘Strategic Partnership’ route. 
 
2.        As with the liberalization of the Indian economy in the 1990s, active involvement of 
the private sector in the manufacturing of major defence equipment will have a 
transformational impact.   It will serve to enhance competition, increase efficiencies, facilitate 
faster and more significant absorption of technology, create a tiered industrial ecosystem, 
ensure development of a wider skill base, trigger innovation, promote participation in global 
value chains as well as exports.  From a strategic perspective, this will help reduce current 
dependence on imports and gradually ensure greater self-reliance and dependability of 
supplies essential to meet national security objectives. 
 
3.        Defence procurement is entirely government led and functions in a monopsony. The 
current defence procurement procedures focus on short/medium term contracts.  The 
emphasis on purchase of equipment alone does not promote the creation of a defence 
industrial eco system. Achieving self- reliance and self-sufficiency calls for assimilation of 
technology, extensive indigenisation, developing an ecosystem of Tier I, II & III partners and 
undertaking long term upgrades of the platforms through R&D. This will require the private 
sector partner selected through a laid down procedure by the government to make necessary 
long-term investments in manufacturing infrastructure, an eco-system of suppliers, skilled 
human resources, R&D for modernization and upgrades as well as and other capabilities, 
besides production of equipment. Such a partnership between the Ministry of Defence and the 
Indian private entity will be known as Strategic Partnership. The overall aim will be to 
progressively build indigenous capabilities in the private sector to design, develop and 
manufacture complex weapon systems for the future needs of the Armed Forces. This will be 
an important step towards meeting broader national objectives, encouraging self-reliance and 
aligning the defence sector with the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government. 

480 
 
4.        This Chapter is divided into the following sections: - 
 
(a)  
Section I. 
Introduction to the Strategic Partnership model, Segments for 
Strategic Partnership and Organisation Structure in the Ministry of Defence. 
 
 
(b)  
Section II. 
Procedure for selection of Strategic Partners (SPs). 
 
SECTION I: THE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP MODEL 
 
5.        The Strategic Partnership model is being implemented to enable participation of 
private Indian firms in Make in India in defence. The SP is expected to play the role of a 
System Integrator by building an extensive eco-system comprising development partners, 
specialised vendors and suppliers, in particular, those from the MSME sector. 
 
6.        The selection criteria for Strategic Partners (SP) will be based on the inherent capacity 
and ability of the vendor to emerge as a systems integrator and to set up a vendor network for 
sourcing. The criteria for selection should be fair, reasonable, non-arbitrary, transparent and 
rational, and based upon the broad parameters of financial strength, technical capability and 
capacity/infrastructure. It is acknowledged that in the Indian private sector currently there is 
limited experience in defence manufacturing and even lesser in respect of final integration of 
complex defence systems and sub-systems. Therefore, besides any experience in defence 
manufacturing, potential SPs will be identified primarily based on their experience and 
competence in integration of multi-disciplinary functional system of systems, engineering 
and manufacturing. Further, to ensure that the chosen platform for manufacturing meets all 
the operational requirements of the Armed Forces and to access advanced and appropriate 
technologies, the SP will need to enter into relevant tie-ups with foreign Original Equipment 
Manufacturers (OEM). Accordingly, MoD will shortlist, through an open process based on 
Staff Qualitative Requirements (SQRs), Technology Transfer needs and indigenisation 
roadmap, a list of potential OEMs.   Government to government support for licensing and 
transfer of technology as well as provisions for IPR issues shall be worked out. At the same 
time, to introduce needed competition among potential private sector participants in the 
process and to ensure that the best interests of government are fully safeguarded, final 
selection of SPs will be guided by the price quoted by the potential SPs. 
 
Segments for Strategic Partnership 
 
7.        In the initial phase, strategic partners will be selected in the following segments: - 
 
(a) 
Fighter Aircraft.  
 
(b) 
Helicopters. 
 
(c) 
Submarines. 
 

481 
 
(d) 
Armoured fighting vehicles (AFV)/Main Battle Tanks (MBT). 
 
8.        To ensure that larger number of companies participate in the process of defence 
manufacturing in the private sector, and the SP maintains focus on a core area of expertise, 
only one SP will generally be selected per segment. Addition of more segments or further 
subdivision of the identified segments may be considered by the MoD as deemed necessary. 
 
9.        Strategic Partnerships seek to enhance indigenous defence manufacturing capabilities 
through the private sector over and above the existing production base. Keeping this broad 
objective in view, MoD may consider the role of DPSUs/OFB at the appropriate stage(s) 
keeping in view the order book position, capacity and price competitiveness. 
  
10.      Cooperative arrangements including transfer of technology and teaming arrangements 
between DRDO/OFs/DPSUs with the SP could be envisaged to enable defence related 
capacities to be developed in the country or for other reasons as decided by MoD. 
 
Applicant Companies 
 
11.      As the Strategic Partnership model is designed to build indigenous manufacturing 
capacity in major defence platforms, the Applicant Company and subsequently the Strategic 
Partner when appointed should be an Indian company (as defined under the Companies Act, 
2013), owned and controlled by resident Indian citizens. The management of the Applicant 
Company should be in Indian hands with majority representation on the board of directors. 
The chief executive(s) of the Applicant Company shall be resident Indians who are part of the 
Indian group owning and controlling the Applicant Company or the Strategic Partner. 
‘Control’ shall include the right to appoint a majority of the directors or to control the 
management or policy decisions, including by virtue of their shareholding or management 
rights or shareholders agreements or voting agreements. 
 
12.      Further, a company shall be considered as ‘Owned’ by resident Indian citizens if more 
than fifty percent (50%) of the capital in it is directly or beneficially owned by resident Indian 
citizens and/or Indian companies, which are ultimately owned and controlled by resident 
Indian citizens. This implies that the maximum permitted FDI shall be forty nine percent 
(49%). No pyramiding of FDI in Indian holding companies or in Indian entities subscribing 
to shares or securities of the Applicant Company or the Strategic Partner shall be permitted. 
Indirect foreign investment shall be accounted for in counting the forty-nine percent (49%) 
FDI.  The consolidated characteristics of ownership and provisions governing Applicant 
Companies are given at Appendix A to this Chapter. 
 
13.      Any subsequent change in shareholding pattern/ownership of the SP shall require prior 
approval of MoD. 
 
 
 

482 
 
Role of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) 
 
14.     To manufacture major defence platforms, the SP will require tie-ups with foreign 
Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), to cover manufacturing, transfer of technology 
(ToT), assistance in training skilled human resources and other support. Such partnerships or 
tie-ups between SP and OEM may take the form of joint ventures (JV), equity partnerships, 
technology-sharing, royalty or any other mutually acceptable arrangement between the 
companies concerned, subject to the ownership conditions indicated in Paragraphs 11, 12 and 
13 above. The limit for equity participation will not preclude other arrangements for sharing 
management rights in the JV mutually agreed between the SP and OEM. Changes in the 
ownership structure of JV/SPV shall require approval of MoD. 
 
15.      The OEM will be jointly responsible along with the SP for certification and quality 
assurance of the platforms supplied to MoD. Rights and obligations in this regard will be 
subject to detailed contracts to be developed subsequently. 
 
16.      To facilitate selection of OEMs, MoD will implement a process of shortlisting of 
OEMs for each segment simultaneously with the process of identifying SPs. This shortlisting 
of eligible OEMs will be through an Expression of Interest (EoI). 
 
17.      Technical Evaluation will also be carried out strictly adhering to specified timelines. 
Even if only one OEM submits a proposal in any given segment, the process of technical 
evaluation will be completed. 
 
18.      As part of the EoI, OEMs will provide a formal acceptance of their government(s) that 
necessary licenses to transfer technology will be granted in case the OEM is selected as a 
partner for the SP to manufacture the platforms/equipment in India, wherever required, prior 
to issue of RFP. Such a commitment may also be supported by Inter-Governmental 
agreements to be signed between India and the country(ies) concerned, at the stage of award 
of contract. 
 
19.      Contract between the SP and OEM will cover provisions for protection of classified 
information and technology transferred by the OEM. Shortlisted OEMs will provide an 
undertaking confirming their willingness to cooperate with the SP to manufacture the 
platform in India, including handholding and support, transfer of technology and 
indigenisation. OEM will also confirm life-cycle support for the platform along with the SP. 
 
Organisational Structure at MoD 
 
20.    An appropriate institutional and administrative mechanism for effective implementation 
of the Strategic Partnerships will be set up within the MoD, with adequate expertise in 
relevant fields like procurement, contract law and ToT arrangements. The procurement 
process for cases under the SP Model is given at Appendix C to this Chapter and the terms of 
reference for Empowered Project Committee are given at Appendix D to this Chapter. 

483 
 
SECTION II: PROCEDURE FOR SELECTION OF STRATEGIC PARTNERS 
 
21. 
The selection process of SP will broadly have following procedure: - 
 
(a) 
Issue of Expression of Interest (EoI) to Indian private companies for selection 
of Strategic Partners in identified segments seeking details of Minimum Qualification 
Criteria. 
 
(b) 
Submission of response to EoI by applicant companies, indicating inter alia 
choice for segments in which they wish to participate. 
 
(c) 
Evaluation of the companies based on Minimum Qualification Criteria.  
 
(d) 
Segment-wise verification of Segment Specific criteria. 
 
(e) 
Shortlisting of companies who meet the minimum qualification criteria, for 
issue of segment-wise RFP. 
 
(f)

Expression of Interest (EoI) 
 
22.      MoD shall issue an EoI to seek applications from Indian private companies for 
selection of Strategic Partner in identified segments.  EoI shall inter alia seek information 
related to Minimum Qualification Criteria comprising of financial, technical and segment-

484 
 
specific parameters.  The EoI shall be given wide publicity both in print and electronic media.  
A suitable time period shall be given to the industry to respond. 
 
23.      The Application should be accompanied by an Affidavit testifying to the truth and 
accuracy of the information supplied. The financial information shall be accompanied by 
unqualified report from the statutory auditor appointed under Section 139 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 or corresponding sections under the previous Companies Act, about the correctness 
and accuracy of the financial information submitted. For any materially false statement, the 
Applicant Company shall be disqualified. 
 
Evaluation of Response to EoI  
 
24.      Based on the response to EoI the companies would be evaluated for minimum 
qualifying criteria comprising technical, financial and segment specific aspects. Indicative 
qualifying criteria for various segments is placed at Appendix B to this Chapter. 
 
25.      Evaluation may inter-alia include on-site verification.  All companies compliant with 
minimum qualifying criteria shall be short-listed for issue of RFP in the relevant segment. 
 
26.       In the event of the Applicant Company not having segment specific experience, 
flexibility is provided to the Applicant Company to rely upon group company(ies)’s 
experience in that particular segment. The segment group company(ies) however will not be 
appointed as the Strategic Partner, as only its experience will be considered for evaluation. 
The specific segment group company(ies) whose experience and expertise is considered shall 
execute a deed of adherence and confirmation cum undertaking providing the MoD and the 
Strategic Partner an irrevocable right to access, enter upon and use the facilities of the 
segment group company for the duration of the Strategic Partnership, subject to applicable 
laws. An agreement evidencing this right in a form prescribed by MoD should be submitted 
along with the application. The restrictions on FDI as prescribed for the Applicant Company 
as a Strategic Partner will also be applicable to the segment group company. 
 
Shortlisting of OEMs 
 
27.      The process of shortlisting of OEMs will be done simultaneously with the process of 
identifying potential SPs. Shortlisting of OEM will involve the following processes: 
 
(a)       Issue of RFI to potential OEMs. 
 
(b) 
Formulation of SQRs. The SQRs will cover aspects of the platform as well as 
weapons required, wherever feasible. 
 
(c)        Based on SQRs and information already available/collected, an EoI will be 
issued to OEMs in each segment. 
 

485 
 
 
 
(d)       EoI shall define the technologies to be acquired including the details of the 
weapons and associated sensors along with the range and depth of transfer of 
technology (ToT) to achieve the stipulated level of indigenisation and development of 
industrial eco-system in India. 
 
(e)       OEMs shall provide response to the EoI within two months. 
 
(f) 
Based on the responses TEC will be carried out. Besides compliance to SQRs, 
TEC will also check compliance to issues listed at Paragraph 27. 
 
(g) 
OEMs that meet TEC requirements will be shortlisted for each segment, with 
the approval of DAC. 
 
(h)       Even if only one OEM is shortlisted, the process will be taken forward. 
 
28.      As ToT is one of the main factors in selection of OEM, the quantum and scope of 
Technology being offered for transfer by the OEM will be a primary consideration in the 
selection procedure, besides compliance to SQRs. Towards this, the shortlisting of OEM will 
inter-alia take into consideration the following factors: - 
 
(a) 
Range, depth and scope of technology transfer offered in identified areas. 
 
(b) 
Extent of indigenous content proposed. 
 
(c)       Extent of eco-system of Indian vendors/manufacturers proposed. 
 
(d)       Measures to support SP in establishing system for integration of platforms. 
  
(e) 
Plans to train skilled manpower. 
 
(f) 
Extent of future R & D planned in India. 
 
Issue of RFP 
 
29.      Based on the AON approved by DAC, segment-wise RFPs shall be issued to the short-
listed Indian companies. RFP shall broadly seek following details: -  
 
(a) 
Technical details of the equipment. 
 
(b) 
Commercial offer for the identified platform and 10-years Performance Based 
Logistics (PBL)/other maintenance arrangements specified. 
 

486 
 
 
(c) 
Mandatory requirements related to indigenisation roadmap, Transfer of 
Technology, creation of R&D capabilities and skilling provisions etc. 
 
30.      The list of short-listed OEMs shall also be annexed to the RFP, so that the short-listed 
Indian companies can freely engage with such OEMs and finalise their techno-commercial 
offer in agreement with any of these OEMs.  One Indian company can engage with any or all 
OEMs, but can finally submit only one offer in agreement with any one of the OEMs. As an 
exception, in segments with diverse platforms such as Helicopters, potential SPs may submit 
response with more than one OEM to have best technology solution. 
 
31.       A minimum number of platforms, not exceeding 10-15% of the number of units being 
procured, may be manufactured in the OEMs premises for the purposes of training and skill 
development of the SP’s manpower. 
 
Response to RFP 
 
32.      Response to RFP shall be in two parts, a technical offer and a commercial offer.  The 
technical offer shall include details of the equipment, company’s willingness to meet 
mandatory requirements related to indigenisation roadmap, transfer of technology, creation of 
R&D capabilities and skilling provisions etc.  The commercial offer shall include the price of 
the platform along with maintenance related costs as required in RFP. 
 
Evaluation of Response to RFP 
 
33.      Technical offer, which contains details of the equipment, company’s adherence to 
certain mandatory requirements related to indigenisation, technology transfer, creation of 
R&D capabilities and skilling etc. shall be opened first. 
 
34.       Field Evaluation Trials (FET)  are  to  be  conducted,  except  where  the  equipment  
has  been evaluated earlier or where FET is not applicable (such as submarines), in which 
case the requirement of FET could be waived. Further, to expedite FET, evaluation trials 
could be carried out at the vendor premises as necessary. 
 
35.      Based on results of FET, Staff Evaluation will be carried out and platforms that meet 
minimum SQRs and ToT requirements will be shortlisted. 
 
36.      After evaluation of the technical aspects, and completion of FET, the commercial 
offers of the companies that are compliant with the technical aspects shall be opened and the 
company having lowest bid shall be designated as SP in that segment. 
 
37.      The order of selection of SPs, segment-wise, and implementation of Strategic 
Partnerships shall be decided by MoD. 
 

487 
 
Contractual Aspects  
 
38.      MoD shall constitute a Contract Negotiation Committee to conduct negotiations with 
the selected SP and sign a contract for deliverables. OEM may participate in these 
negotiations if needed. 
 
39.      Contract for supply of the platform will be signed between MoD and the SP, and with 
OEM if necessary. In case a JV/SPV is formed by the OEM and SP, a tripartite contract 
between MoD, SP and the JV/SPV will be considered, provided this does not dilute 
responsibilities of the SP individually, jointly and severally for implementation of contractual 
delivery timelines, quality and other criteria. 
 
Indigenisation Roadmap 
 
40. 
The selected SP in each segment will be required to present a roadmap for future 
development including PBL, upgrades, etc. as indicated below: - 
 
(a)      Indigenous Content Requirements.         The SP shall commit to a plan to 
indigenise, in terms of value of production, manufacturing of the platform over a set 
period for each platform as defined in each RFP. 
 
(b) 
Eco-system of Domestic Manufacturers.      SP shall develop tiered 
industries in each segment by entering into teaming agreements and development 
partnerships with other industries, including micro, small and medium enterprises 
(MSMEs), DPSUs, OFs, other PSUs, DRDO and foreign companies that are part of 
the global supply chain in the relevant sector, so that an eco- system of domestic 
manufacturers in Indian defence sector is developed, including for spares and 
capacities for repair and maintenance of the platform. SP will submit an action plan to 
MoD in this regard, implementation of which will be monitored by MoD. 
 
(c)       R & D Roadmap.       The Strategic Partner shall formulate a research and 
development roadmap to achieve self-reliance within the country in respect of the 
Segment. The road-map is to be mutually finalised along with the MoD. 
 
Test and Evaluation Facilities 
  
41. 
MoD will make available existing test and evaluation facilities to the SP. The terms of 
such access as well as cost or fees for the same shall be mutually decided. 
 
Periodic Assessment 
 
42.      MoD shall have a right to periodically assess level of technology absorption carried 
out by the SP and development of a domestic ecosystem for manufacturing. MoD may carry 

488 
 
out this assessment either itself or by appointing subject matter experts. 
 
Audit 
 
43.      Besides examination of periodic audited reports, MoD shall have the right to conduct 
special audits of all certifications and costs relevant to the Segment at all or any stages (tiers) 
of manufacturing/ production/ assembly. 
 
Termination 
 
44. 
MoD shall have the right to terminate the Acquisition Contract in the following 
cases:- 
 
(a) 
If there is material breach of the Acquisition Contract or an integrity related 
provision by the SP or the JV/SPV. 
 
(b) 
If the SP or the JV/SPV loses 50% (fifty percent) of net worth as submitted in 
its application (for appointment as strategic partner) or is unable to pay its dues. 
 
(c) 
If the SP or the JV/SPV is adjudged insolvent, commences a voluntary 
winding-up, is subject to the appointment of a receiver, administrative receiver, 
official liquidator, trustee or a similar person over its assets or undertaking or any part 
thereof. 
 
(d) 
Any other contractually relevant issue. 
 
Subsequent Acquisitions 
 
45.    To achieve self-reliance within the country, subsequent acquisitions in the identified 
segments/platforms should ideally be carried out from Indian companies under Buy (IDDM), 
Buy (Indian), Buy and Make (Indian) and Make categories of acquisition under DAP. This 
can be accomplished only when Indian companies make considerable, long term investments 
in capacity creation and capability development including infrastructure, tiered ecosystem of 
vendors, skilled human resources, futuristic R&D etc. 
 
46.      To incentivise and motivate Indian companies to achieve these objectives, the process 
for evaluation of bids for subsequent acquisitions in the identified segments/platforms may 
provide adequate weightage for the following factors pertaining to their experience and track 
record in the respective segment: - 
  
(a) 
Investments by Indian companies to construct and improve segment specific 
infrastructure like workshops and production lines as well as availability of skilled 
manpower. 
 

489 
 
(b) 
The nature of R&D investments made by the companies including test and 
evaluation facilities and infrastructure. 
 
(c) 
Development and acquisition of relevant technologies and execution of 
advanced and state of the art manufacturing processes. 
 
(d) 
The extent of the ecosystem created such as the number of vendors developed 
and the value of orders placed on these vendors. 
 
47.      Further, in order to encourage spiral development of technologies and systems, the 
above factors may be given adequate weightage in deciding upon development partners for 
projects, including those of DRDO, as well as those under Make procedure of DAP. 
 
48.      The above factors may also be given adequate weightage in deciding upon Indian 
partners for enhancing the production capacities/establishing work-share with DPSUs/OFs in 
future. 
 
Conclusion 
 
49.      Fostering a constructive partnership with Indian private defence industry is considered 
not just a sound economic option but a strategic imperative to minimise dependence on 
imports and infuse self- sufficiency in defence manufacturing. Larger and sustained 
production volumes of a system will lead to optimisation of cost, improved production 
efficiency and ability to absorb higher end technologies, besides creating an extensive eco-
system of defence related industries in the country so that defence manufacturing emerges as 
a key driver in India’s economic growth and development.

Appendix A  
 
(Refers to Paragraph 12 of 
 
 
Chapter VII) 
 
OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE 
 
1.         Ownership Structure and Form.    The applicant must be a public company as 
defined under the Companies Act, 2013 (“Applicant Company”). The objective of the 
Strategic Partnership model is to build capabilities in India to manufacture defence 
equipment. In certain extreme circumstances of conflict like war, the GoI would have the 
right to acquire control over the intellectual property used and facilities developed pursuant to 
the Strategic Partnership. 
 
2.        The Applicant Company and subsequently the Strategic Partner when appointed 
should be an Indian company owned and controlled by resident Indian citizens. The 
management of the Applicant Company should be in Indian hands with majority 
representation on the board of directors. The chief executive(s) of the Applicant Company 
shall be resident Indians who are part of the Indian group owning and controlling the 
Applicant Company or the Strategic Partner. 
 
3.        The calculation of foreign investment in the Applicant Company shall include: - 
 
(a)       The paid up equity share capital held by the foreign company either by itself 
through its subsidiary companies or nominees in the Applicant Company; 
 
(b)       The paid up equity share capital held by other foreign investors in the 
Applicant Company; and 
 
(c)       The quantum represented by that proportion of the paid-up equity share capital 
to the total issued equity share capital held or controlled by persons mentioned in (a) 
or (b) above in an Indian company or a limited liability partnership which is a 
shareholder in  the Applicant Company (“Indian Entity”). It is pertinent to note that, 
for the calculation of foreign equity in the Indian Entity equity held by Foreign 
Portfolio Investors (“FPI(s)”) (category I and II only) and Indian mutual funds will 
not be included. 
 
4.        Further, a company is considered as ‘Owned’ by resident Indian citizens if more than 
fifty percent (50%) of the capital in it is directly or beneficially owned by resident Indian 
citizens and / or Indian companies, which are ultimately owned and controlled by resident 
Indian citizens. This implies that the maximum permitted FDI shall be forty nine percent 
(49%). No pyramiding of FDI in Indian holding companies or in Indian entities subscribing 
to shares or securities of the Applicant Company or the Strategic Partner shall be permitted. 
Indirect foreign investment shall be accounted for in counting the forty-nine percent (49%) 
FDI. 

491 
 
5.  
‘Control’ shall include the right to appoint majority of the directors or to control the 
management or policy decisions including by virtue of their shareholding or management 
rights or shareholders agreements or voting agreements. For example, in the event Company 
A, having twenty five percent (25%) FDI (and no other foreign investment), holds fifty 
percent (50%) of the Applicant Company, presuming the Applicant Company has no other 
foreign investment, it shall be construed to have twelve point five percent (12.5%) of foreign 
investment. 
  
6.        The application should be supported by an Affidavit testifying to the truth and 
accuracy of the information supplied. 
 
7. 
The financial information shall be accompanied by unqualified report from the 
statutory auditor appointed under Section 139 of the Companies Act, 2013 or corresponding 
sections under previous Companies Act, about the correctness and accuracy of the financial 
information submitted. For any materially false statement, the Applicant Company shall be 
disqualified. 
 
8.        The Strategic Partner shall be permitted to incorporate subsidiary companies in the 
nature of SPV or use existing subsidiaries as SPVs in respect of specific projects or contracts 
awarded by the MoD when procurement contracts are required. No other assignment of the 
contract or project shall be permitted. The status and contract with the Strategic Partner is not 
assignable. Final integration of system of systems shall be carried out by the Strategic Partner 
or its SPV in India. SPV shall be wholly owned by the Strategic Partner and the shareholding 
of such a Strategic Partner in the SPV should be locked in for the term of the Strategic 
Partnership. The only permitted exception to this condition is that in case of company(ies)  or  
entity(ies)  providing  technology  for  a  project  or  a  contract  so  requires  such 
company(ies) or entity(ies) shall together be allowed a maximum of forty nine percent (49%) 
in the SPV without loss of control or ownership of the SPV by the Strategic Partners. The 
making of the SPV and the terms of the joint venture shall be scrutinised by the MoD to 
ensure that the SPV and/ or the Strategic Partner are Indian owned and majority controlled by 
resident Indian citizens as defined in Paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 above. Such SPVs should be set 
up in compliance with the policies and guidelines issued from time to time by the Department 
of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry. However, the 
overall responsibility of performance as owed to the MoD shall always be that of the 
Strategic Partner. Strategic Partner and SPV(s) would be jointly and severally liable. SPV’s 
joint and several liability(ies) with the Strategic Partner shall be prorated to the extent of its 
work share, as agreed at the time of approval of the SPV by the MoD.

2. 
The RFI will be sent to potential foreign OEMs for seeking relevant information, on 
specific procurement schemes. The issue of RFI is not a commitment for procurement.  
 
 

495 
 
3. 
The main objectives of the RFI are as follows: - 
 
(a) 
To formulate /refine /rationalise the SQRs (PSRs for submarines); this 
exercise may involve rational combination of different product specifications and 
shall result in a practical and achievable product requirement. 
 
(b)

496 
 
6. 
RFI is also advance intimation for the OEM to obtain requisite government 
clearances.  At least three months shall be given to OEMs after issuing the RFI, for a 
structured response and interaction. 
7. 
RFI shall be formulated by SHQ, in consultation with DRDO, DDP and HQ IDS to 
ensure that comprehensive response is generated from OEMs to facilitate addressing all 
aspects of operational requirements.  A copy of the RFI will be shared with DRDO, DDP and 
HQ IDS, for their comments, which shall be provided within four weeks, post which it will 
be considered as ‘nil-comments’. The comments obtained may be duly incorporated, 
wherever applicable. RFI shall also ask for details about the OEMs as per Annexure II of 
Appendix A to Chapter II. 
 
8. 
Suitable interactions with the OEMs will be planned by the SHQ.  After interaction, 
OEMs may be given adequate time to respond to the RFI. 
 
Formulation of SQRs (SRs for Submarines) 
 
9. 
Based on the Operational Requirements (ORs)/OSRs for submarines and the RFI 
response the SHQs will formulate Staff Qualitative Requirements (SQRs)/ Preliminary Staff 
Requirements (PSRs) in consultation with all stakeholders, as per procedure enumerated in 
succeeding paragraphs.  For the segments of fighter aircraft, helicopters and armoured 
fighting vehicles the SQRs shall be appended to the SoC, while seeking AoN.  In case of 
submarines, Preliminary Staff Requirements (PSRs) will be attached to the SoC. 
 
Services Qualitative Requirements (SQRs) {Preliminary Staff Requirements (PSRs) for 
Submarines} 
 
10. 
Characteristics of Services Qualitative Requirements (SQRs). Capital acquisitions 
for Fighter Aircraft, Helicopters and Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) segments will be 
based on SQRs, which need to lay down the fundamental user requirements in a 
comprehensive manner.  The SQRs need to be detailed, realistic, achievable and verifiable 
and must avoid ambiguity of any type.  SQRs must be broad based and must not be tailored 
from/ for a particular product or service and must result in procurement of the items that best 
meet the requirements of the forces.  As far as possible, SQRs shall specify the requirements 
of military grade, ruggedised and Commercially Off the Shelf (COTS) items.  It may not be 
viable for all SPs to produce a complex and costly equipment precisely customised for unique 
requirements, within limited time and in limited numbers, for assessment and evaluation at 
Field Evaluation Trial (FET) stage.  Hence the parameters of SQRs, are classified as under: - 
 
(a) 
Essential Parameters-A. 
These parameters are generally a part of the 
contemporary equipment available in the market and form the core of the SQR; 
Essential Parameters- A will be tested and validated at FET stage. 
 
(b) 
Essential Parameters-B. 
Though 
not 
available, 
originally 
in 
the 
equipment fielded for the FET, these parameters can be developed and achieved by 

497 
 
the SPs in conjunction with OEMs, using available technologies. These parameters 
need to be tested and validated within a specified time frame as stipulated in the 
contract.  These tests for Essential Parameters- B shall also validate that there is no 
adverse effect on any of the Essential Parameters- A.  However, SPs shall be able to 
substantiate and need to provide an undertaking, at stage of responding to RFP that 
they will develop and meet the Essential Parameters-B in partnership with the OEM, 
within their existing capabilities. 
 
(Note: In procurement cases involving Essential Parameters-B, an Additional Bank 
Guarantee valued between 5% and 10% of the contract value of equipment required 
with Essential Parameters- B, as determined by the AoN according authority, needs to 
be submitted, in addition to the Performance Bank Guarantee. The quantum of the 
Additional Bank Guarantee must be stated in the RFP issued to prospective Indian 
SPs.  Failure to meet the Essential Parameters- B after signing of the contract and 
within the stipulated time frame, will lead to forfeiture of all bank Guarantees 
(Performance Bank Guarantee, Additional Bank Guarantee and Advance Bank 
Guarantee if any) and attract other penal provisions as may be prescribed by the 
Government.  On meeting the Essential Parameters-B as per contract terms, the 
Additional Bank Guarantee will be released and returned to the contracted vendor 
(Indian SP).  Essential Parameters-B will not be evaluated at the FET stage, even if 
any equipment, as claimed by the OEM(s), can meet them.  Essential Parameters- A 
and Essential Parameters-B (if applicable) are non-negotiable requirements to be met 
by the SP and the OEM, prior to commencement of equipment delivery.  The 
provision to incorporate Essential Parameters-B will be used only when required, with 
DAC’s approval and will not be used when two or more OEM claim to possess the 
same at the RFI stage.  Essential Parameters-B will not be included where only single 
OEM is shortlisted.  Essential Parameters-B may also be incorporated in the SoC, for 
provision of partial quantities of the items being procured, to meet different/ higher 
specification for specific operational requirements). 
 
(c) 
Enhanced Performance Parameters (EPP). 
EPP are those parameters 
that enhance the capability of the equipment vis a-vis the essential parameters; a SQR 
may not contain EPP in all cases.  Inability to meet the EPP does not preclude SPs 
from being eligible for the bidding/ bid evaluation.  However, if a SP claims to have 
equipment meeting the EPP as specified in SQR and RFP, then they must provide 
details of the same in their technical bids, which have to be tested for compliance 
during the FET itself.  Equipment successfully meeting the EPP parameters will be 
awarded a credit socre of up to 10%, for evaluation of L1, with each individual 
attribute not exceeding a credit score of up to 3%, as approved by the AoN according 
authority.  Bid evaluation criteria/ determination of L1 for categories of cases 
involving EPP, is as elucidated below: - 
 
(i) 
In case procurement involves EPP, then the EPP and their credit scores 
need to be explicitly detailed in the RFP (issued to Indian SP).  In such cases, 

498 
 
if the equipment supplied by an SP does not have the EPP, then the 
commercial quote of the SP, for the purpose of L1 determination, remains as it 
is. 
(ii) 
In cases where an SP’s equipment meets the EPP, the commercial 
quote will be multiplied by a credit factor less than 1 and greater than or equal 
to 0.9, based on the additional technical score assigned for the EPP, as detailed 
in the RFP.  For example, if a SP quotes ₹ 10 Crores for an equipment and 
meets a certain EPP for which an additional credit score of 2% is being 
provided, then the commercial quote of this SP will be considered for L1 
determination purpose only, as ₹ 9.8 Crores (10 Crores multiplied by 0.98) and 
not ₹ 10 Crores. However, for all purpose other that L1 determination, the 
value of the commercial quote will be considered as ₹ 10 Crores only.  
 
11. 
Characteristics of Staff Requirement (SRs) for Submarines. In case of 
submarines, capital acquisitions will be based on Staff Requirements (SRs), which need to 
lay down the fundamental user requirements in a comprehensive manner. The SRs need to be 
detailed, realistic, achievable and verifiable and must avoid ambiguity of any type. The 
parameters of SRs are classified as under:- 
 
(a) 
Outline Staff Requirements (OSRs). SHQ is to prepare the Outline Staff 
Requirements (OSRs), which are to include the role of the submarine, dimensions of 
its hull, limiting dimensions if any, capability of major machinery, weapons, sensors 
and details of accommodation, manpower, endurance, etc. The OSRs will form the 
basis on which the feasibility studies and concept design of the submarine, 
identification of OEMs/Vendors for specific weapons, sensors, machinery and 
equipment are to be carried out. 
 
 
(b) 
Preliminary Staff Requirements (PSRs).  OSRs are to be refined based  on 
 
the RFI and thereafter converted into PSRs. 
 
 
(c) 
Staff Requirements (SRs).  EoI process will seek final validation of the 
 
PSRs. After deliberations with OEMs for feasibility of incorporating all 
 
requirements of PSRs into the design of the Project, SRs are to be finalised. 
 
12. 
Preparation. 
 
(a) 
The SQRs (SRs for submarines) will be drafted by the user directorate at SHQ. 
In order to make broad based SQRs (PSRs for submarines), information obtained 
through the issue of RFI is to be considered. The inputs so obtained shall result in the 
form of a compliance table of SQRs (PSRs for submarines), vis-a-vis technical 
parameters of equipment available in world market, in as much detail as possible. For 
submarines, PSRs will be converted into SRs based on EoI response/discussions in 
accordance with Paragraph 11 (c) above. 
 

499 
 
(b) 
Draft SQRs (SRs for submarines) will be circulated by SHQ to all stake 
holders concerned including other possible user directorates, maintenance directorate, 
HQ IDS, DRDO, DDP, Director General of Quality Assurance (DGQA)/Director 
General of Aeronautical Quality Assurance (DQAQA)/Director General Naval 
Armament Inspectorate (DGNAI) (as applicable), Directorate of Standardisation, 
Technical Managers and any other necessary department for obtaining their 
views/comments. The agencies will also be represented on the Staff Equipment Policy 
Committee (SEPC) for approving the SQRs (SRs for submarines).  In cases where 
their is commonality of equipment, HQ IDS will constitute a Joint Staff Equipment 
Policy Committee (JSEPC) with representation from the services concerned, for the 
preparation of the Joint Service Quality Requirements (JSQR), if an ab-initio single 
OEM/SP situation is likely, then the case will progress as per provisions of Paragraph 
31 of Chapter II. 
 
13. 
The resources of SEPC may be augmented by professional technical experts who have 
extensive knowledge/experience on the equipment/systems under consideration. Their 
services shall be utilized for review, rationalization and finalization of the SQRs/SRs, prior to 
accord of approval. SHQ/HQ IDS may maintain a list of such experts drawn from academia 
and /or experts from industry, as required. 
 
14. 
Approval.  SQRs (SRs for submarines) must be cleared by SEPC and approved by 
the competent authorities at the respective SHQs. 
 
Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) 
 
15. 
In order to seek AoN, the SHQ will prepare a SoC as per format at Appendix B to 
Chapter II. The SoC will be signed, with date, by the Head of the respective User, Plans 
Directorate/equipment of the Services. Seven copies of the SoC will be prepared, justifying 
the procurement proposal. One copy each will be forwarded to HQ IDS, DDP, DRDO, MoD 
(Finance), JS & AM, ADG Acquisition Technical and FM. HQ IDS will examine aspects of 
interoperability and commonality of equipment of the three Services. All stakeholders will 
forward their comments to SHQ within four weeks, who will then compile all the comments 
and give their final views. The SoC will thereafter be forwarded to HQ IDS for fielding in the 
SPB. 
 
16. 
After evaluating the recommendations of the stake holders, the SPB will examine the 
case, and if found in order, refer it to DAC for accord of AoN. 
 
17. 
In order to ensure that AoN according process is completed in a time bound manner, 
each case will be processed by DRDO/DDP/MoD/MoD (Finance) within four weeks of 
receipt, so that the proposal is considered by the AoN according authority within a four to six 
weeks cycle. 
 

500 
 
18. 
At the time of accord of AoN, DAC shall consider the participation of DPSUs/PSUs 
in the specific proposal, keeping in view the order book position, capacity and price 
competitiveness. In case of Submarine segment, DPSU are also required to have previous 
experience in construction of submarines. 
 
Empowered Project Committee (EPC) 
 
19. 
For smooth and efficient implementation of Strategic Partnership Model, DG 
(Acquisition) is to constitute Empowered Project Committees (EPC) under a three star officer 
from the SHQ/(lead Service for Joint cases) for each of the SP cases, and with JS level 
members drawn from MoD (Acquisition), DDP, MoD (Finance), DRDO, Advisor (Cost), and 
DGQA, as applicable. The Empowered Project Committee may co-opt additional subject 
matter experts with adequate domain expertise in relevant fields like procurement, contract 
law and ToT arrangements, on as required basis. 
 
20. 
The Committee shall be guided by Chapter VII of DAP 2020, on Revitalising Defence 
Industrial Ecosystem through Strategic Partnerships’ and the Guidelines as enumerated in this 
document. The board terms of reference for the Empowered Project committee are placed at 
Appendix D to Chapter VII. 
 
Transaction Advisors 
 
21. 
To enable smooth and effective implementation of the Strategic Partnership (SP) 
Model a Transaction Advisor (TA) may be hired for undertaking the “Advisory Service” by 
providing assistance (including legal) to MoD/EPC during selection of Strategic Partners 
(SPs) and Foreign OEMs. The TA will inter-alia be responsible for assisting the EPC in 
formulation and evaluation of EoI and RFP, as well as formulation of Contract documents. 
The TA will also ensure legal vetting of EoI and RFP prior issue as well as vetting of the 
responses, besides legal vetting of Contract documents. 
 
Expression of Interest (EoI) 
 
22. 
After accord of AoN by DAC, the Empowered Project Committees (EPC) will issue 
separate EoI to Indian Industry/ DPSU (wherever applicable) and foreign OEM(s) with an 
aim to shortlist potential SPs and OEM(s) respectively, as per procedures enunciated in 
subsequent paragraphs. 
 
EoI for Shortlisting of SP 
 
23. 
EPC shall issue an EoI to seek applications from Indian Private Industry/ DPSUs (as 
applicable) for selection for Strategic Partner in identified segments. EoI shall inter alia seek 
information related to Minimum Qualification Criteria comprising of financial, technical and 
segment-specific parameters. The EoI shall be hosted on the MoD website and given due 
publicity. Potential SPs shall provide response to the EoI within two to four months 

501 
 
depending upon the assessment of EPC. Any extension sought beyond stipulated time period 
and upto a period of eight weeks shall be approved by the Chairman of EPC, based on the 
merits of the case. The extension so accorded shall be equally applicable to all stakeholders. 
Request for any further extension shall be sought from DG (Acquisition). 
 
EoI for Shortlisting of Foreign OEM 
 
24. 
The process of shortlisting foreign OEMs will be done simultaneously with the 
process of identifying potential SPs. Based on SQRs (PSRs for submarines) an EoI will be 
issued to potential OEMs shortlisted at the RFI stage. Subsequent to the accord of AoN, 
additional vendors who did not respond to the RFI, can also express interest for receipt of 
EoI, within four weeks from the date of publication of details on the MoD and SHQ websites. 
EoI shall inter-alia define the following: - 
 
(a) 
Technologies to be acquired along with the range and depth of transfer of 
technology (ToT) to achieve the stipulated level of indigenisation and development of 
industrial eco-system in India. The ToT requirements shall be identified in 
consultation with DRDO and other stakeholders. 
 
(b) 
Progressive indigenisation desired both in respect of main platform as also 
spares/ maintenance. 
 
(c) 
Willingness to support SP in establishing system for integration of platforms, 
implementation of ToT and life cycle support/ Performance Based Logistics/ MToT/ 
maintenance aspects. 
 
25. 
EoI may also seek details that go into determining the cost of the scheme, including 
factors such as maintenance philosophy, Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC), Performance 
Base Logistics, R&D roadmap, training etc, to assist in arriving at effective benchmarking 
subsequently. 
 
26. 
EPC shall ensure that the potential foreign vendors are Original Equipment 
Manufactures (OEMs) for Export Agencies authorized/ sponsored by foreign Governments 
(applicable in the case of countries where domestic laws do not permit direct export by 
OEMs). While short-listing the OEMs, EPC shall take into account their ability to transfer 
requisite technology for indigenous production. 
 
27. 
In this context, OEMs will need to indicate whether they have consulted their 
government(s), and necessary licenses to transfer technology will be granted in case the OEM 
is selected as a partner for the SP to manufacture the platforms/ equipment in India. Wherever 
required, OEMs will be required to provide a letter of assurance from their respective 
government, prior to issue of RFP. Such a commitment may also be supported by Inter-
Governmental agreements to be signed between India and the country(ies) concerned, either 
once the L1 has been determined or at the stage of award of contract. 

502 
 
28. 
OEMs shall provide response to the EoI within two to four months depending upon 
the assessment of EPC. Any extension sought by the foreign OEM beyond stipulated time 
period and upto a period of eight weeks shall be approved by the Chairman of EPC in 
accordance with provision of Paragraph 60 below, based on the merits of the case. The 
extension so accorded shall be equally applicable to all stakeholders. Request for any further 
extension shall be sought from DG (Acquisition). 
 
29. 
Based on the responses, EPC shall hold consultations with the potential OEMs. These 
consultations will inter-alia relate to SQRs (PSRs for submarines), technology transfer 
aspects, delivery timelines, and indigenisation roadmap proposed. 
 
30. 
The final shortlisting of OEMs shall inter-alia into consideration the following 
factors: - 
 
(a) 
Range, depth and scope of technology transfer offered in indentified areas. 
 
 
(b) 
Extent of indigenous content proposed. 
 
 
(c) 
Extent of eco-system of Indian vendors/ manufactures proposed. 
 
 
(d) 
Measures to support SP in establishing system for integration of platforms 
indigenisation efforts, ToT implementation and life cycle support or Performance 
Based Logistics/ MToT/ maintenance aspects. 
 
 
(e) 
Plans to train skilled manpower. 
 
 
(f) 
Extent of future R&D planned in India. 
 
31. 
Transfer of Technology (ToT). 
 
 
(a) 
The primary objective of SP Model is to progressively build indigenous 
capabilities in the private sector to design, develop and manufacture platforms/ 
complex weapon systems for the future needs of the Armed Forces. To achieve this, 
ToT needs to be optimized to effectively infuse desired critical technologies into the 
industrial eco-system to enable self-sufficiency for Next-Gen indigenous defence 
systems. 
 
 
(b) 
ToT for Submarines. In case of submarines, the aim of ToT will also be to 
fill in the gaps in the design expertise at SHQ/ Shipyard, besides leveraging current 
project to obtain critical technologies to achieve self-reliance in submarine design and 
construction in the long term. 
 
 
(c) 
Scope, Range and Depth of ToT.  During discussions with foreign OEMs at 
the EoI stage, EPC will explore feasibility of maximising ToT. Based on the 

503 
 
deliberations during the EoI stage, EPC will finalise the scope, range and depth of the 
ToT. The board terms of reference for ToT can be as follow: - 
 
 
 
(i) 
Identify Transfer of Technology (ToT) modules required for extant/ 
 
future platforms. ’Segment-specific technologies may also be included for 
 
ToT, as applicable. 
 
(ii) 
Identify the depth, range and scope of technology required for each 
module. 
 
(iii) 
Identify maintenance technologies required for life-cycle support of the 
platforms, as well as associated technologies that are envisaged per the 
proposed maintenance philosophy. 
 
 
(d) 
As ToT, comes at a considerable price, it needs to be incentivised. 
 
32. 
Indigenous Content (IC).  India has developed a vibrant industrial ecosystem, which 
is engaged in design and manufacture of cutting-edge components. In line with the ‘Make in 
India’ initiative of Government of India, the EPC, needs to make all efforts to maximised IC 
in the project. Similar to ToT, the IC also needs to be incentivised. 
 
33. 
EoI-Areas for Incentivisation. In order to realise full potential of the SP Model, it is 
essential to provide rational and transparent incentives to OEMs offering ToT and IC over 
and above the Minimum Qualifying Threshold. Towards this, EPC in consultation with 
Transaction Advisers is to draw out a transparent mechanism, as follows: - 
 
(a) 
ToT.  Set Minimum Qualifying Threshold with respect to number of 
technology modules required to be transferred. Additionally, accord suitable 
weightage for these technology modules to duly compensate for their cost. 
 
(b) 
IC.  Accord suitable weightages for additional IC, especially in respect of 
hardware (equipment and platform), that is excluding the services, work force and 
infrastructure costs. Indigenous Content will be calculated only for the ‘Make’ 
component of the Contract. Additionally, BNE/ BFE, as well as Tax and levies will 
not be considered towards IC calculation. 
 
(c) 
Exclusive Global Hub. Similar consideration/ weightage is to be accorded to 
OEMs, who offer to setup exclusive global manufacturing line or exclusive hub for 
MRO/ spares in India. 
 
(d) 
Building Indigenous Eco-System. Lay down minimum cut off percentage (by 
value) for Tier I/II/III/IV OEM suppliers to progressively manufacture their 
equipment/parts/spares in India. SPs, which ensure higher percentage of 
indigenisation, over and above the cut-off limit, will be incentivised. 

504 
 
34. 
EoI Approval.  
EoI prepared by the EPC with above provisions would be 
examined and approved by DG (Acquisition) on file, prior to issue. 
 
35. 
Given the diversity and complexity for the four segments under the SP Model; that is, 
Helicopters, Fighter Aircraft, Submarines and Armoured Fighting Vehicle, the ToT 
requirements as also Indigenous Content for each of the platform would vary, and 
accordingly specific details to be included in the EoI for each of the four segments will be 
issued separately. 
 
36. 
On receipt of EoI response, the EPC will nominate a team under SHQ to undertake 
technical evaluation, to examine the extent of variations/differences in the characteristics of 
the equipment being offered by various OEMs, as also other provisions. The technical 
evaluation will be submitted to EPC for seeking further clarifications/technical discussions 
with the OEMs. 
 
37. 
Cost Estimate. 
During the EoI process, approximate cost estimation received 
as per RFI response may be further refined to assist subsequently in benchmarking during 
CNC. 
 
38. 
Finalisation of SRs for Submarines. 
Based on the EoI deliberations, the PSRs 
for submarines are to be converted into SRs as per procedure enumerated at Paragraphs 10 to 
14 above, prior to presenting the case to DAC for 2nd Stage approval. 
 
Second Stage DAC Approval 
 
39. 
Once the potential SPs and foreign OEMs have been shortlisted the EPC shall seek 
DAC approval. The SoC is to be accompanied with draft RFP, and is to also list out proposed 
‘Incentivisation Model’ (giving out the areas being incentivised along with the 
Incentivisation procedure). The SoC is to also include broad trial methodology including 
cases where trials are not visualized or trials need to be conducted abroad in OEM/vendor 
premises in accordance with Paragraph 34 of Chapter VII of DAP 2020, or where evaluation 
is planned through computer simulation. 
 
Buyer Furnished Equipment (BFE) and Buyer Nominated Equipment (BNE) 
 
40. 
BNE/BFE will be clearly defined in the RFP. EPC is to formulate the lists of BFE and 
BNE and undertake consultations with OEM and SP on integration issues during the EoI 
stage. Both the SP and the OEM(s) of the BNE/BFE will be responsible for seamless 
integration of their equipment, while ensuring the performance parameters of the platform. 
Inclusion of BNE in projects under SP Model is to be in accordance with MoD ID No 
1(13)/D(Acquisition)/16 dated 30 Jun 17 (as amended from time to time). 
 

505 
 
41. 
Procurement of Submarine Borne Equipment. 
The procurement of submarine 
borne equipment will be undertaken by the shipyard in accordance with the shipyards internal 
policy, as is being followed for construction of naval ships. 
 
42. 
BNE being Procured from OFB. 
   In 
cases 
involving 
Buyer 
Nominated 
Equipment being procured from OFB, the commercial bid will clearly indicate the cost of 
BNE as quoted by OFB, with documentary proof. L1 in such cases will be determined after 
deducting the cost of the OFB supplied BNE, from the total cost quoted by the SP. However, 
payment will be made after adding the actual cost of BNE at the time of purchase from OFB 
by the SP, to the L1 cost determined as mentioned above; the cost of equipment supplied by 
OFB will be considered including GST. This provision is applicable only in cases where the 
BNE has to be procured from OFB. Inclusion of BNE in projects under SP Model is to be in 
accordance with MoD ID No 1/(13)/D(Acquisition)/16 dated 30 Jun 17 (as amended from 
time to time). 
 
43. 
Weapons and Sensors. 
 
 
(a) 
In case of some platforms, not all the potential collaborators (OEMs) 
 
may be able to provide the complete range of weapons/sensors required from the 
 
platform. 
Further, 
due 
to 
geo-strategic 
conditions, 
the 
governments 
of 
 
collaborators may not be willing to offer weapons/sensors to OEMs of certain 
 
other countries. EPC is therefore to arrive at a Weapon/Sensor Matrix indicating the 
 
likely source of weapons/sensors for the shortlisted platforms catering for the geo-
 
strategic sensitivities of various OEMs. The  Weapon/Sensor Matrix is to include the 
 
options of importing foreign weapon  systems / sensors already inducted and / or on 
 
offer, both proven and under development. 
 
(b) 
Such procurements of weapons/sensors will be undertaken post selection of 
the SP and foreign OEM (collaborator for the main platform), and will not be 
considered as Single Vendor procurement. Such a commitment, may, if required, be 
supported by Inter-Governmental agreements to be signed between India and the 
country(ies) concerned, at the stage of award of contract. 
 
(c) 
Contract with SP is to include the likely weapons/sensors and their OEMs that 
have been shortlisted for the selected platform as per the Weapon /Sensor Matrix. It is 
to further define the clear division of responsibility between SP and weapons/sensors 
OEM with regard to integration, testing and proving of these weapons/sensors. 
 
Solicitation of Offers 
 
44. 
Once the DAC approval has been obtained for shortlisted potential SPs and OEM(s), 
RFPs shall be issued to the short-listed Indian companies. 
 

506 
 
45. 
Solicitation of offers will be as per ‘Single Stage- Two Bid System’. It will imply that 
a RFP will be issued soliciting the technical and commercial bids together, but in two 
separate and sealed envelopes. 
 
46. 
RFP: Vetting and Issue. 
The procedure for RFP vetting and issue will be as 
follows: - 
 
(a) 
SHQ will prepare draft RFP in consultation with all agencies concerned such 
as procurement and maintenance directorates at SHQ, Quality Assurance agencies, 
DRDO, etc. 
 
(b) 
After the draft RFP has been circulated and necessary changes incorporated, 
where applicable, it is to be submitted to EPC.  
 
(c) 
EPC is to finalise the RFP, after single-stage vetting and forwarded it to DG 
(Acquisition) for approval. SHQs shall however ensure that all issues/observations 
raised by the stakeholders are taken into consideration and resolved as applicable, 
prior forwarding the draft RFP to EPC. 
 
(d) 
Once approved, the RFP will be issued by the TMs on behalf of the EPC. 
 
Request for Proposal (RFP) 
 
47. 
The RFP will be a self-contained document that will enable SPs to make their offer 
after consideration of full requirements of the acquisition. The RFP document will be 
finalized base on the EoI evaluation/deliberations. Wherever required, Transaction Advisers 
may be consulted. This will be applicable for all acquisitions under the SP Model. Besides 
the name of shortlisted OEMs, the RFP will generally consist of five parts as under:- 
 
(a) 
The first part elaborates the general requirement of the equipment, the 
numbers required, the time frame for deliveries, the environmental parameters for 
functioning, conditions of usage and maintenance, requirement for training, 
Engineering Support Package (ESP)/Performance Based Logistics (PBL), and 
warranty/guarantee conditions etc. It specifies the prescribed procedure and last date 
and time for submission of offers. 
 
(b) 
The second part of the RFP incorporates the SQRs (SRs for submarines) 
describing the technical parameters of the proposed equipment in clear and 
unambiguous terms.  In case equipment is being procured for the first time and needs 
to be evaluated, the RFP will include the requirement of field evaluation on a ‘No 
Cost No Commitment’ (NCNC) basis.  Compliance of offers will be determined only 
based on the parameters spelt out in the RFP. 
 

507 
 
(c) 
The third part of the RFP outlines the commercial aspects of the procurement, 
including clear statements on Payment Terms, Performance-cum Warranty 
Guarantees, and Additional Bank Guarantee in respect of Essential Parameters-B (if 
applicable) and Guarantees against Warranty Service to be performed by the supplier. 
It also includes standard contract terms along with special contractual conditions, if 
any. 
 
(d) 
The fourth part of the RFP defines the criteria for evaluation, trial 
methodology and acceptance, both in terms of technical and commercial contents. A 
format will be enclosed for submission along with commercial offer to facilitate 
preparation of Comparative Statement of Tenders (CST) duly incorporating credit 
score for EPP wherever applicable and identification of Lowest (L1) SP. Submission 
of incomplete details in the format enclosed, along with commercial offer, will render 
the offer liable for rejection. 
 
(e) 
RFP will also include the approved ‘Incentivisation Model’. 
 
48. 
In addition, the RFP shall also seek following requirements (as determined during EoI 
process); - 
 
 
 
(a) 
ToT (scope, range and depth). 
 
 
 
(b) 
ToT for maintenance infrastructure.  
 
 
 
(c) 
Mandatory requirements related to indigenisation roadmap, creation of R&D 
capabilities and skilling provisions etc. 
 
 
 
(d) 
Maintenance philosophy, such as performance Based Logistics, Annual 
Maintenance Contract (AMC), other maintenance arrangements, etc.  
 
Maintenance Philosophy 
 
49. 
Given the importance of the weapon platforms/systems being acquired under the SP 
Model, there is a need to formulate a suitable maintenance philosophy in consultation with 
OEMs Besides Level 1 to Level 2 maintenance with Services, due cognizance is to be given 
to Performance–Based Logistics (PBL) to optimize systems readiness and meet performance 
goals for a system/platform through long term support arrangements with clear lines of 
responsibility. SHQ may choose any one or a combination of the various options listed in 
succeeding paragraphs.  
 
50. 
Performance-Based Logistics (PBL). 
PBL is the purchase of support as an 
integrated, affordable, performance package designed to optimize system readiness and meet 
performance goals for a system/platform through long-term support arrangements with clear 
lines of authority and responsibility. Simply put, performance-based strategies buy outcomes, 

508 
 
not products or service. The SP will continue to remain the single point of contract for 
obsolescence management, availability of maintenance eco-system and supply chain thereby 
ensuring the defined availability of the platforms in accordance with the original 
specifications for the duration of Platform Life. The scope and estimated costs of PBL may 
be obtained during EoI stage and finalised prior issue of RFP. 
 
51. 
Spares. 
The Services will stock all the Level 1 to Level 2 maintenance/ 
breakdown spares, as well as B&D and war reserve spares. Additionally, the RFP shall also 
seek cost of the manufacturer’s Recommended List of Spares (MRLS), Itemised Spares Parts 
Price List, optional equipment and the likely consumption rate of the spares based on the 
exploitation pattern of the equipment, as applicable.  The RFP shall also seek roadmap for 
indigenous production of spares, besides mentioning that the SP/OEM shall finalise the terms 
for lifetime product support. 
 
52. 
The provision of ToT to SP for providing maintenance infrastructure will be 
applicable for SP Model cases. The foreign OEM will have to transfer technology for 
maintenance to SP, which will be responsible for providing base repairs (third line), and the 
requisite spares for the entire life cycle of the equipment the RFP will spell out the specific 
requirements of ToT for maintenance  infrastructure that could cover the production of 
certain spares, establishment of base repair facilities including internationally accredited test 
facilities and the provision of spares for the entire life cycle of the equipment. The SP will be 
responsible for providing maintenance facilities and support of the equipment, through its life 
cycle. 
 
53. 
Adequate training of personnel for undertaking ‘O’ Level and ‘I’ Level maintenance 
without the involvement of SP may also be factored. 
 
54. 
SP will also be considered for undertaking depot level servicing, refits, as also mid-
life upgrade of the platforms, as and when due. 
 
Modifications for Submarines 
 
55. 
Due to long gestation period, the construction of submarines may require to 
accommodate unforeseen changes necessitated due to minor operational requirements of the 
user etc. There may be occasions when systems/equipment, which are still under 
development or those not fully evaluated, have to be considered in order to ensure that the 
submarine, when ready has the latest state of art capabilities at the time of induction into 
service. Further, due to operational reasons, adaption of developmental systems, shortfalls 
observed during installation/trails of equipment/ systems etc, may require modifications in 
design. Since it is not feasible to forecast these, a provision needs to be made for the same 
while obtaining CCS/CFA approval. In this context, the DAC will examine the extent of 
modification cost recommended by the SHQ during the accord of AoN. Based upon the DAC 
decision, a percentage of the project cost will be included in the CFA approval on ‘Not 
Exceeding Basis’ for modifications. Towards this, the detailed procedure and cost 

509 
 
methodology for modifications will be incorporated in the segment specific guidelines issued 
for the submarines. EPC is to also incorporate the same in the RFP as well as the Contract. 
 
SP Interaction with OEM 
 
56. 
The list short-listed OEMs along with extracts of EoI, as necessary, shall also be 
annexed to the RFP, so that the short-listed Indian companies can freely engage with such 
OEMs and finalise their techno-commercial offer in agreement with any of these OEMs. One 
Indian company can engage with any or all OEMs, but can finally submit only one offer in 
agreement with any one of the OEMs. 
 
57. 
Pre-bid Meeting. 
Consequent to the issue of RFP, a number of queries relating to 
the RFP may be raised by the potential SPs. It shall be ensured that all the queries are 
answered in an acceptable time frame so that the potential SPs are able to submit their 
techno-commercial offers by the due date. If necessary, a pre-bid meeting of all the potential 
SPs may be invited by the SHQ under the aegis of EPC. The clarifications shall be processed 
by the SHQ and be given in writing to all the shortlisted SPs by the Member-Secretary EPC 
preferable within three weeks of the pre-bid meeting. However, it needs to be ensured that the 
SQRs (SRs for submarines) shall not be changed/ amended at this stage. 
 
Evaluation of Response to RFP 
 
58. 
The offers received shall be opened on the notified date and time, by the members of 
a committee nominated by EPC and chaired by the TMs, in the presence of the bidders or 
their authorised representatives, as may choose to be present. The Committee will open the 
envelope containing the sealed technical and commercial offers. The technical offer will be 
opened by the committee and sent to SHQ for evaluation by the Technical Evaluation 
Committee (TEC) and the sealed envelope containing the commercial bid will be sent to the 
concerned AM in the EPC, unopened. Offers which do not conform to the prescribed 
procedure for submission of offers, or which are received after the scheduled time for 
submission of offers and unsolicited offers, will not be accepted. 
 
59. 
In case a single bid is received at the bid submission stage, the Technical Evaluation 
Committee nominated by SHQ will proceed with the process and complete the Technical 
Evaluation without retracting the RFP. Within four weeks from the acceptance of the 
Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) report, the case must be referred to the AoN 
according authority. In case it is concluded that there is no scope for change in SQRs and 
other conditions of the RFP, and that retraction and reissue of RFP is not likely to increase 
the SP-OEM base, then the case may be progressed with the approval of DAC, provided the 
SP agrees to hold the original commercial bid till completion of the procurement process. In 
such single vendor situation, efforts shall be made to complete the acquisition process before 
expiry of original validity of commercial bid. 
 

510 
 
60. 
Extension of Time.  
No extension of time will be provided under normal 
circumstances. However, situations may arise in which it may be appropriate to extend the 
time allowed for submission of offers. If the SP is seeking an extension, the request with 
justification must be received by the member- secretary of the concerned EPC at least two 
weeks prior to bid submission date, failing which such requests may not be entertained. Upto 
a period of eight weeks from the original date of submission of offers, the extension can be 
granted by the Chairman EPC. For any further extension, approval is to be sought from the 
DG (Acquisition). 
 
Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) 
 
61. 
A TEC will be constituted by the Service Headquarters under intimation to Chairman 
EPC for evaluation of the technical bids received in response to RFPs. It will include 
representative of the user service, maintenance agency, DRDO and representatives of QA, as 
deemed necessary. The TEC will examine the extent of variations/differences, if any, in the 
characteristics of the equipment offered by various OEMs with reference to the QRs and 
prepared a “Compliance Statement’ short listing the equipment for trials/induction into 
service, as applicable. TEC will also examine compliance of SPs to other provisions of RFP. 
Non-compliance of SP to any of the required provisions will lead to rejection of the bid at 
this stage. The TEC may invite the SPs (along with OEMs, if required) for technical 
presentation/clarifications on technical issues. 
 
62. 
A technical offer, once submitted, shall not undergo subsequent material changes. 
However, minor variations which do not affect the basic character/profile of the offer may be 
acceptable, under the following conditions: - 
 
 
(a) 
To ensure fair play, an opportunity to revise minor technical details shall be 
 
accorded to all SPs in equal measure. 
 
 
(b) 
No dilution of SQRs (SRs for submarines) is carried out. 
 
 
(c) 
No extra time is given to any SP to upgrade their product to make it SQR 
 
compliant, except in case of Essential Parameters-B. 
 
 
(d) 
 The original commercial quote submitted earlier must remain firm and 
 
fixed. 
 
63. 
The Chairman EPC will formally accept the report of the TEC, after due examination 
by the EPC in cases where all SPs are compliant. In cases where one or more SP(s) are non-
compliant, the TEC report is to be referred to DG (Acquisition) for approval. Issues, if any, 
raised by the EPC members on the TEC Report shall be addressed in a collegiate manner with 
SHQ. In case technical evaluation by TEC leads to a single vendor situation, the procurement 
process will continue as planned without retracting the RFP for this reason. EPC will 
however examine reasons for single vendor situation, record the same in their report and 

511 
 
submit the report to the DAC. In case it is concluded that there is no scope for change in 
SQRs (SRs for Submarines) and other conditions of the RFP; and that retraction and reissue 
of RFP is not likely to increase the SP/OEM base, then the case may be progressed further 
with the approval of the DAC, provided the SP agrees to hold the original commercial bid till 
completion of the procurement process. In such single vendor situation, efforts shall be made 
to complete the acquisition process before expiry of original validity of commercial bid. 
 
Field Evaluation Trials (FET) 
 
64. 
After completion of the TEC, all shortlisted SPs will be asked to provide the desired 
number of units of the equipment/ weapon system for trials in India, except when trials are to 
be conducted at OEM/vendor premises to expedite FET in accordance with Paragraph 34 of 
Chapter VII of DAP 2020. 
 
65. 
FET will be conducted by the User Service based on trial methodology given in the 
RFP. The trial methodology shall be comprehensive and un-ambiguous in its scope. 
Methodology for evaluation of each parameter shall also be clearly detailed in the RFP, so 
that the SPs/ OEMs fully understand its implications. Parameters, which can be evaluated at 
TEC stage, based on documents or certificates rendered by accredited agencies, may not be 
included in the field trails. The scope of field trials shall be optimized to cover all required 
parameters and the trial methodology must be approved by the PSO concerned at the SHQ, 
prior to the inclusion in the RFP. 
 
66. 
SHQ will formulate the Trial Directive in conformity with the trial methodology 
given in the RFP and constitute the Trial Team. The Trial Directive must specify the 
fundamental points that need to be addressed for validating the essential parameters and EPP 
along with the evaluation credit, scope thereof, as stipulated in SQRs. The SQRs of the 
equipment will be a part of the trial directive. Parameters not mentioned in the RFP shall not 
be considered for FET. The validation of the support system and maintainability trials, 
integral to and complementing the trial programme of the weapon system shall be held 
simultaneously, wherever feasible. Representative of DRDO, QA agency may also be part of 
FET, based on requirement. A representative of the EPC/Acquisition Wing may also 
participate in the FET as an observer. Compliance or otherwise, vis-à-vis the RFP parameters, 
will be specifically communicated to all the SPs/OEMs at the trial location itself. It will also 
be ensured that all verbal communication with the SPs/OEMs is confirmed in writing within a 
week and all such correspondences are recorded and documented. FET shall be conducted by 
the user and a detailed Field Evaluation Report shall be drawn up and sent to SHQ for Staff 
Evaluation. 
 
67. 
FET will be conducted by the user, only pertaining to conditions where the equipment 
is most likely to be deployed.  In other conditions where the probability of deployment is not 
high, appropriate certifications confirming the functional effectiveness under such conditions 
may be obtained; in cases where applicable, simulations-based testing may be resorted to.  
All weather testing shall be carried out only in cases in which such testing is absolutely 

512 
 
essential.  All the requirements for FET must be stated in the trial methodology included as 
part of the RFP. 
 
68. 
Trials for Submarines. 
 
 
(a) 
The requirement of Field Evaluation Trials, as per Chapter II of DAP 2020, 
will not be applicable for procurement cases in respect of acquisition / construction of 
Submarines, where there is no prototype available for conduct of NCNC Trials. 
However, Technical Evaluation and Delivery Acceptance Trials for these will be 
carried out. 
 
 
(b) 
Further, Simulated Signature Studies of complete platforms in respect of 
 
stealth characteristics, magnetic signature, EMI/EMC, Noise analysis, etc, may be 
 
included. The requirement of trials in the case of specialized new induction 
 
equipment/sensors being bought through the shipyard route shall be detailed in the 
 
RFP. 
 
 
 
(c) 
Liquidated Damages (LD) for Performance Penalties.     Since there  
will 
be no FET for submarines and the performance parameters of the platform will only 
be evaluated during the Acceptance Trials, there may be a need to impose 
performance-based penalties, through reduction in vessel cost on the lines of relevant 
provisions in the Chapter XII, in respect of multiple user defined parameters. The 
EPC may decide the list of Performance Parameters for acceptance of submarines, 
failure of which will attract ‘outright rejection’ and ‘imposition of LD’. For reference, 
EPC may consult previous Submarines contracts of the GoI to arrive at suitable 
clauses. Inputs form the SHQ based on experience gained over a period of time on 
construction / acquisition / operation of submarines may also be factored in 
formulating the LD clauses, as required. 
 
69. 
The trial team, for equipment being procured for more than one Service will have 
representative of each Service for whom equipment is being procured.  Such trial team will 
be headed by representative from the Service nominated as the lead Service. 
 
70. 
Single OEM equipment being fielded by multiple Indian SPs may have joint trials if 
two or more Indian SPs so desire. The Indian SPs, who will jointly field the equipment, may 
place a request and provide an undertaking that they will accept the trial results jointly and 
severally. 
 
71. 
FET will be conducted on NCNC basis. There may be cases where trials are not 
visualised or trials need to be conducted abroad in OEM/ vendor premises. Where held 
evaluation is not feasible, there may be possibility of conducting evaluation through 
computer simulation. In such cases, the broad scope of the trials shall be included in the SoC 
while seeking DAC approval for shortlisted SPs and OEMs. 
 

513 
 
72. 
There may be cases when, during the process of trials in India, it emerges that certain 
validations need to be carried out abroad in the OEM/ vendor premises. This may be 
necessitated due to export restrictions, security related issues, availability of testing 
infrastructure/platforms or such like reasons. Permission for such validations to be carried out 
abroad will have to be sought from the DG (Acquisition). 
 
73. 
In certain cases, particularly in those involving integration of systems or sensitive 
equipment the EPC can depute a multi-disciplinary Technical Delegation abroad for 
evaluation.  The Technical Delegation shall have representatives, on need basis, from the user 
service, DRDO, Maintenance agency, QA agency and the TMs. Such committee will be 
constituted after due approval of the Defence Secretary on file. 
 
74. 
Any SP failing to produce equipment for trials by due date will normally be given a 
grace period of 15 days to produce the equipment for trials. An additional grace period of up 
to 30 days may be obtained by SHQs from EPC, keeping in view the practical time period 
necessary for trials. Equal opportunity will be provided to all SPs while granting such grace 
period. SPs, who fail to provide their equipment even after providing 45 days grace period, 
will be asked to explain the reasons for the delay in producing equipment for trials. If the 
reasons for delay furnished by the SP is found satisfactory by SHQ, case for granting grace 
period beyond 45 days will be processed by SHQ through EPC, for approval of DG 
(Acquisition) Additional, grace period could be accorded law MoD ID No. 3(26) D(Acq)/16 
dated 03 Apr 18. However, if the equipment is not fielded at the start of trials, then the 
SP/vendor/equipment will not be considered at a later point of time.    
 
Staff Evaluation 
 
75. 
The Staff Evaluation will analyse, the Field Evaluation results and shortlist the 
equipment recommended for introduction into the services. The Staff Evaluation Report will 
be forwarded by the SHQs to the EPC. Issues, if any, raised by the EPC on the Staff 
Evaluation Report, shall be addressed in a collegiate manner with the SHQ. After due 
examination, the EPC will forward the Report to the DG (Acquisition) for acceptance. 
 
76. 
In case no SP meets the SQRs in the field evaluations, then the case will be foreclosed 
after informing the DAC. A fresh RFP will be issued after reformulating the SQRs. The 
ADGs Acquisition Technical, on behalf of EPC will inform the appropriate SPs about result 
of trials and evaluation, along with reasons for disqualification. Such communication will be 
done after acceptance of TEC/Staff Evaluation (Whichever is applicable). 
 
77. 
Cases, in which bids have been submitted by more than one bidder in a competitive 
manner and the Staff Evaluation (after trials).  Shortlists only one equipment for introduction 
into service, will not be considered as a single vendor situation, as the techno-commercial 
offers would have been received before trials and the commercial bids would be competitive 
in nature.  In other terms, bidders would have submitted their offers in an open competition 
without being aware that only a single bidder would get approved after the trials. 

514 
 
 
Contract Negotiation Committee (CNC) 
 
78. 
CNC Composition. The CNC will be constituted by the DG (Acquisition) 
simultaneously with conduct of FET.  The standard composition of the CNC shall be as 
follows: - 
 
 
(a) 
EPC Chairman  
 
- 
Chairman. 
 
 
(b) 
Acquisition Manager. 
 
 
(c) 
Technical Manager. 
 
 
(d) 
Finance Manager. 
 
 
(e) 
Advisor (Cost). 
 
 
(f) 
DGQA/DGAQ/DQAN Representative, as applicable. 
 
 
(g) 
Procurement Agency Representative. 
 
 
(h) 
User Representative. 
 
 
(j) 
Representative of Contract Management Branch at SHQ. 
 
 
(k) 
Repair Agency Representative. 
 
 
(l) 
Director/Jt Director from User Directorate – Member Secretary. 
 
 
Notes: 
 
 
(i) 
Chairman CNC may co-opt additional advisors/Subject Matter             
 
 
Experts as associates with approval of DG (Acquisition), on as required       
 
 
 
basis. 
 
(ii) 
The organizations /agencies concerned shall ensure that their 
representatives in the CNC have adequate background and authority to take a 
decision without any need to refer back to their organization / agency.  
 
 
(iii) 
In the absence of the designated member, the authorized 
 
representative would be deemed to be suitably empowered to take  decisions.
 
 
79. 
CNC shall establish a benchmark and reasonableness of price, as a preliminary 
activity in an internal meeting.  Cases in which contracts have earlier been signed and 
benchmark prices are available, the CNC will arrive at the reasonable price, taking into 

515 
 
consideration the escalation/foreign exchange variation factor.  Wherever necessary, services 
of experts or information from institutional sources may be utilized by the CNC for preparing 
benchmark price for a given scheme.  The benchmarking shall be completed after FET, but 
prior to acceptance of Staff Evaluation.  The commercial bids however shall be opened only 
after successful acceptance of Staff - Evaluation Report. 
 
80. 
The sealed commercial offers of the technically accepted SPs shall be opened by the 
CNC at a predetermined date and time under intimation to SPs, permitting such SPs or their 
authorized representatives to be present, wherever applicable.  The bids of the competing 
firms shall be read out to all members present and signed by all members of CNC.  CNC will 
carry out all processes after opening of commercial bids, till the finalisation of CNC Report. 
 
81. 
The contract negotiation process will start with preparation of a ‘Compliance 
Statement’ incorporating the commercial terms offered in the RFP and that sought by the 
SP(s), analysis of the discordance and the impact of the same.  A similar statement will be 
prepared in regard to deviations noticed in the delivery schedules, performance-cum-
warranty/guarantee provisions, acceptance criteria, Engineering Support Package (ESP) etc.  
Comprehensive analysis of the commercial offer will form the basis for subsequent decisions.  
 
82. 
The CNC will prepare a Comparative Statement of Tenders (CST) with a view of 
evaluating the technically acceptable offers and determine the lowest acceptable offer               
(L1 SP). The methodology detailed in Paragraph 31 to 33 above, will be used wherever 
weightage for ToT, IC, global hub and indigenous eco-system are applicable. 
 
83. 
Once the L1 SP is identified in multi-vendor cases, the contract shall be concluded 
with the SP and normally there will be no need for any further price negotiations.  However, 
It is important that reasonability of prices being accepted for award of contract is established.   
 
84. 
Once the commercial offers are opened and the price of the SP is found to be within 
the benchmark fixed in the internal meeting, there shall be no need to carry out any further 
price negotiations.  The RFP in multi-vendor cases shall clearly lay down that no negotiations 
will be carried out with the L1 SP once the reasonability of the price quoted by the SP is 
established.  Aspects of advance and stage payments (where applicable) shall also be given 
upfront in the RFP so that it facilitates selections of L1 SP.  
 
85. 
The endeavour shall be to conclude the CNC early so that the operational/urgent 
requirement of the indenting Service is met in a time-bound manner. 
 
86. 
To ensure product support during the assured life cycle of the product, the CNC will 
also finalise the following with the L1 SP:- 
 
 
(a) 
Assured supply of information on product/technological improvement, 
 
modifications and upgrades. 
 
(b) 
Obsolescence management and life time purchases. 

516 
 
 
 
(c) 
An illustrated spares price catalogue with base price and pricing  
mechanism 
 
for long-term. 
 
87. 
Vetting of the draft contract will be progressed concurrent with CNC process in 
accordance with DAP 2020. 
 
Other Procurement Processes/Steps 
 
 
88. 
Other aspects relevant to procurement such as Inter Government Agreement, 
Approval of Competent Financial Authority (CFA), Award of Contract, Contract 
Administration and Post-Contract Management and subsequent procurement of already 
contracted equipment (Repeat Order), etc, shall be processed as per extant procedures listed 
at Chapter II of DAP 2020, to the extent applicable. Once the SP having the lowest bid has 
been shortlisted, no additional DAC approval will be required for commencement of 
contractual negotiations, or for approval of the Competent Financial Authority (CFA). 
 
89. 
The Pre-Contract Integrity Pact (PCIP), listed as detailed in Paragraph 119 Chapter II 
of DAP 2020, shall apply mutatis mutandis. 
 
90. 
Periodic Monitoring.  Given the importance of cases being pursued under the SP 
Model, DG (Acquisition) will review all cases on quarterly basis. 
 
91. 
Process Flow Chart. The Process Flow Chart for cases being progressed under SP 
Model is placed as Annexure. 
 
92. 
Conformity with DAP. 
In following the above procedure for progressing cases 
under SP Model, any deviation, discrepancy or issues unresolved between the stakeholders 
are to be referred to the DG (Acquisition) for clarification and decision. Further any changes 
in DAP and/or policy letters on common processes will apply to the above procedures mutatis 
mutandis.

519 
 
3. 
The Committee shall be guided by Chapter VII of DAP 2020, on ‘Revitalising 
Defence Industrial Ecosystem through Strategic Partnerships’ including Appendix C to 
Chapter VII of DAP 2020 and the Guidelines as enumerated in this document. The EPC shall 
steer the case from the formulation of the Expression of Interest (EoI) to conclusion of the 
Contract, as mentioned in the succeeding paragraphs. However, finalization and approval of 
SQRs (SRs or submarines) will remain the responsibility of the SHQs. 
 
Expression of Interest (EoI) 
 
4. 
Shortlisting of Strategic Partner (SP).  
The committee is to undertake the 
following with respect to shortlisting of SP:- 
 
(a) 
Formulation of EoI including defining Minimum Qualifying Criteria for the 
Technical & Finance Gates and Segment Specific criterion. 
 
(b) 
Issuance of EoI to Indian Private Industry/ DPSUs (as applicable) for selection 
of Strategic Partners. Keeping the security and other relevant aspects in view, 
appropriate publicity may be given to the proposed procurement with a view to 
generated maximum competition. 
 
(c) 
Evaluation of EoI responses by applicant companies based on minimum 
qualification Criteria comprising financial, technical and segment-specific parameters 
Verification of the qualified applicant companies for applicable segment to be carried 
out as per Appendix B to Chapter VII of DAP 2020. 
 
(d) 
Shortlisting of qualified SPs for the concerned Segment. 
 
5. 
Shortlisting of Foreign OEM. 
The process of shortlisting of OEMs will be 
done simultaneously with the process of identifying potential SPs. Based on SQRs (PSRs for 
submarines) an EoI will be issued to potential OEMs shortlisted at the RFI stage. Subsequent 
to the accord of AoN, additional vendors who did not respond to the RFI, can also express 
interest for receipt of EoI, within four weeks from the date of publication of details on the 
MoD and SHQ websites. EoI shall inter-alia define the following:- 
 
(a) 
Technologies to be acquired along with the range and depth of transfer of 
Technology (ToT) to achieve the stipulated level of indigenisation and development 
of industrial eco-system in India. The ToT requirements shall be identified in 
consultation with DRDO and other stakeholders. 
 
(b) 
Progressive indigenisation desired both in respect of main platform as also 
spares/maintenance. 
 

520 
 
(c) 
Willingness to support SP in establishing system for integration of platforms, 
indigenisation efforts, ToT implementation and life cycle support/ performance Based 
Logistics/maintenance aspects. 
 
(d) 
Approximate cost estimation to assist in subsequent benchmarking. 
 
6. 
EPC shall ensure that the potential foreign vendors are Original Equipment 
manufactures (OEMs) or Export Agencies authorised/ sponsored by foreign Governments 
(applicable in the case of countries where domestic laws do not permit direct export by 
OEMs). While short-listing the OEMs, EPC shall take into account their ability to transfer 
requisite technology for indigenous production. 
 
7. 
Transfer of Technology (ToT).  
ToT being one of the primary objectives of 
procurement under the SP Model, EPC is to explore feasibility of maximising ToT, especially 
for critical technologies, as enumerated at Paragraph 31 of Appendix C to Chapter VII. 
 
8. 
Indigenous Content (IC). 
India has developed a vibrant industrial ecosystem, 
which is engaged in design and manufacture of cutting edge components. In line with the 
‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government of India, the EPC, needs to make all efforts to 
maximise IC in the project. Similar to ToT, the IC also needs to be incentivised. 
 
9. 
Areas for Incentivisation.   To provide impetus to indigenisation, EPC is to 
incentivise ToT and IC. OEMs, who offer to setup exclusive global manufacturing line or 
exclusive hub  for MRO/ spares in India, shall also be incentivised. 
 
10. 
Building Indigenous Eco-system.   To develop indigenous defence eco-system, Tier 
I/II/III/IV OEM suppliers need to be encouraged to either set up indigenous manufacturing or 
enter into a joint venture with Indian Companies to progressively manufacture their 
equipment/parts/spares in India. Towards this, EPC, based on EoI response is to lay down 
minimum cut off percentage (by value) for Tier I/II/III/IV OEM suppliers to progressively 
manufacture their equipment/parts/spares in India. SPs, which ensure higher percentage of 
indigenisation, over and above the cut-off limit, need to be incentivised.  To create favourable 
environment for OEM suppliers to shift manufacturing to India, EPC may also explore other 
measures such as concessionary provisions for exports, customs, taxes, etc. 
 
11. 
For incentivisation, the EPC in consultation with Transaction Advisers will need to 
draw out appropriate ‘Incentivisation Models’ which accord suitable weightages for the 
factors highlighted above. The ‘Incentivisation Models’ will be vetted by MoD (Fin) and DG 
(Acquisition); and be presented to DAC for second stage approval. The EPC is to be guided 
by Paragraph 31 to 33 of Appendix C to Chapter VII of DAP 2020. 
 
12. 
Weapons and Sensors.   All the potential collaborators may not be able to provide 
the complete range of weapons required for the platform. Further, due to geo-strategic 
conditions, the governments of collaborators may not be willing to offer weapon/sensor 

521 
 
systems to OEMs of certain other countries. EPC is to arrive at a Weapon/sensor Matrix 
indicating the likely source of weapons/sensors for the shortlisted platforms catering for the 
geo-strategic sensitivities of various OEMs in accordance with Paragraph 43 of Appendix C 
to Chapter VII of DAP 2020. 
 
13. 
Maintenance Philosophy. 
Given the importance of the weapon platforms/systems 
being acquired under the SP Model, EPC, post discussions with foreign OEMs is to formulate 
a suitable maintenance philosophy in consultation with SHQs and incorporate the same in the 
RFP document. Besides Level 1 to Level 2 maintenance with Services, due cognisance is to 
be given to Performance-Based Logistics (PBL) to optimise system readiness and meet 
performance goals for a system/platform through long-term support arrangements with clear 
lines of responsibility. Wherever applicable, MToT shall be made a mandatory pre-requisite, 
and the EoI and RFP shall include the need for MToT and setting up of internationally 
accredited testing and certification facilities in India in greater detail. 
 
14. 
EPC in consultation with SHQ, may recommend any one or a combination of the 
various options listed at Paragraph 50 to 54 of Appendix C to Chapter VII of DAP 2020.

1. 
Preamble.     Acquisition of Systems and Information & Communication Technology 
(ICT) products is in a few aspects different from the regular acquisition projects.  The software 
and hardware elements of these projects usually require periodic up-gradations and intense 
obsolescence management to maintain tactical dominance in C4I2, EW and Cyber domain.   To 
provide an efficient and agile acquisition mechanism for acquisition and up-gradation of such 
products, certain provisions are incorporated in this Chapter, to be read in conjunction with 
relevant provisions of Chapter-II of Defence Acquisition Procedure. While the majority of the 
aspects of this chapter are relevant for Systems as well as ICT projects, a few are relevant only 
for ICT projects as mentioned in the succeeding paragraphs.

4. 
Preliminary Planning.     Preliminary planning involves engagement of executing/ 
procurement Directorate with the users to understand their concept of operations, functional 
requirements, environment, external systems and legacy systems with which the required 
capability needs to interface, interoperability requirements, threats, existing capabilities, and 
other specific needs to explore various possible solutions so as to arrive at the most optimal 
system architecture and software design.  The chosen software development methodology and 
architecture needs to include the following features:- 
 
(a) 
Functional requirements/ Specifications. 
(b) 
Identification of software/ system vulnerabilities and mitigation measures to 
ensure security.  
(c) 
The Software Architecture shall align, support and reflect the continuous evaluation 
and enhancement of capability and adoption of new technologies over the software 
lifecycle.  
(d) 
Interoperability and interfaces with legacy systems.  
(e) 
Compliance of the architecture with good design principles including but not 
limited to modular open systems architecture, and supports frequent iterative capability 
releases.  
 
5. 
Defining Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and Minimum Viable Capability Release 
(MVCR).     MVP is an early version of the software that has just enough working features to 
meet basic minimum functional capabilities. The goal of an MVP is to quickly deliver basic 
capabilities into users' hands for evaluation, feedback, and improvements. The MVP will be 
derived from Functional requirements/ User Requirement Specifications (URS) created at 
Project Preliminary Planning stage. The MVCR is a set of features suitable to be delivered to an 
operational environment that provides value and capability to the end user on a reduced delivery 
timeline. The goal of the MVCR is to deliver software products that meet the initial set of user 
needs and initial capabilities that can be fielded to enhance a few mission outcome(s).  The 
system design of ICT projects shall bring out and define MVP and MVCR and the product 
roadmap shall bring out the plan for delivery of remaining capabilities at periodic intervals. In 
the case of Systems projects, MVP and MVCR are not applicable. 
 
6. 
Building in Upgradability.     The System & ICT hardware may have modular and 
layered architecture to enable retention of the Core hardware and upgrading the hardware at the 
outer layers.  Similarly, the software shall be modular to the extent feasible for subsequent up- 
gradation as required, to keep the system effective and ahead of the technology scale and 

528 
 
adversary counter measures.  Proprietary and customised portion of Commercial software used 
in or meant to interoperate with the software being developed should have documented open 
interfaces to allow for technology insertion and to support the use of modular open system 
approaches.   
 
7. 
Preliminary Project Report (PPR).     Depending on the size and complexity of the 
project, a multi- disciplinary team may be set up by the SHQ with the representatives of the user 
branch/ Directorate and the executing Directorate to prepare a PPR. The PPR may have 
traceability to the Functional requirements/ URS, MVP and MVPR.The Team may comprise 
of internal reps of the Services, external consultants who may be engaged for this purpose from 
various Institutions/ Industry segments/ Academia etc and/ or reps of DRDO. If the system is 
being developed by DRDO, the member from DRDO shall not be from the developing 
laboratory.  The draft PPR (without any sensitive information) may be shared with the 
industry during EoI/ RFI and the PPR be finalised considering the vendor feedback. Apart from 
the preliminary project plan, technical specifications/ User Requirement Specifications (URS), 
implementation roadmap etc, the PPR will also clearly bring out the aspects brought out at    
Para 4 and stage/ phase wise implementation plan along with timelines and clear responsibility 
of each stakeholder at each stage along with approximate overall cost and its breakdown.  
 
8. 
Request for Information (RFI).      While the typical Systems projects may follow RFI 
process i.a.w. with Para 2-13 of Chapter-II of DAP-2020, RFI shall aim at ascertaining the 
available technological choices and project approach, vendor base and vendor capabilities based 
on financial capacity, technical expertise and past experience in delivering similar projects. 
Participation in RFI by vendors is not a prerequisite for issuing the RFP.  
 
9. 
Engagement of Consultants.     For complex and turnkey Systems and ICT projects, 
where in-house expertise for conceiving the project, its implementation and methodology for 
development is not adequate, external experts, institutions/ consultancy firms/ academicians 
(from premier academic institutions) having required specialized knowledge/ capability may be 
engaged as consultants to provide assistance in exploration of possible solutions and formulation 
of optimal software design and system architecture, establishing the feasibility of leveraging 
existing in-house network resources, selection of appropriate technology, converting the 
functional requirements into the desired  technical  specifications/ URS, preparation of 
Preliminary Project Report (PPR) etc and expenditure for engaging external experts shall be 
borne from Revenue budget. Each Service Directorate may create a list of external experts, 
institutions, consultancy firms/ academicians (from premier academic institutions). This list may 
be made available on the SHQ website. A procedure may be created for new inclusion from time 
to time in this list. A Memorandum of Understanding/ NDA agreement may be signed with 
external experts, institutions/ consultancy firms/ academicians by clearly defining the 
accountability and responsibility of both parties, after following the due process of selection.  
10. 
SoC and AoN.     The SoC is to be prepared in accordance with Para 21 of Chapter-II 
and processed for AoN i.a.w. Para 21 to Para 31 of Chapter-II.  In addition, SoC of all ICT and 
Systems projects shall furnish the following details as applicable:-  
 

529 
 
(a) 
Outline programme of the project that is consistent with the user’s requirements 
so as to demonstrate the MVP/ MVCR within 12-18 months of the contract effective 
date.   
(b) 
The acquisition strategy along with the plan for supporting the software through 
its life cycle and clearly defined test and evaluation requirements.  
(c) 
Utilisation of existing hardware, networks and infrastructure to the extent feasible 
and the details of requirement of creation of unique facilities. 
(d) 
Details of utilisation of iterative and incremental software development 
methodologies (such as Agile or Lean) and use of modern technologies to achieve 
automated testing, continuous integration and continuous delivery of user capabilities, 
frequent user feedback/ engagement at each iteration as possible. 
(e) 
Details of security and authorisation process and use of continuous runtime 
monitoring of operational software. 
(f) 
Given the importance of the modular architecture for ease of upgradation, 
modularity in the architecture and open systems approach to support future capabilities 
and upgradation is to be highlighted in the SoC.  
(g) 
Intellectual property strategy. 
(h) 
Requirement of automated testing and Testing and acceptance procedure. 
11.    Turnkey Projects.     The Complex and Systems Projects involving supply of hardware, 
creation of infrastructure and netware, installation and commissioning involving ICT system 
developers and system integrators may be assigned to software developers and/ or system 
integrators i.a.w. the procedure laid down at Para 32 of Chapter-II by clearly bringing out the 
details of the project in the Detailed Project Report (DPR). In addition to further details on 
various aspects brought out in the PPR, the DPR shall clearly bring out the scope of various 
deliverables, division of responsibility between stakeholders and the approximate overall cost 
and the estimates for each of the packages. If the preparation of a Detailed Project Report 
requires hiring of consultants for whom the expenditure is to be incurred from the Capital 
budget, a case is to be taken up with AoN according authority for AoN, duly justifying the 
requirement in the SoC. If the DPR is already prepared in-house or through consultants as at 
Para 9, AoN for turn-key projects may be processed directly in one stage. 
 
12. 
AoN for Post-AoN Activities.     Specific AoN for hiring consultants for post-AoN 
activities like project monitoring, security auditing, testing etc is to be sought while seeking 
AoN for the project and the expenditure be booked from the project expenditure.   
 
13. 
Hiring of Consultants.     Consultants for preparation of DPR as at Para 11 above and 
post AoN activities as at Para 12 above may be engaged through a contract with suitable firms 
or a Memorandum of Understanding with a DPSU/ Central  or state Government Agency/ 
Department / Institution by clearly defining the  accountability and responsibility of both parties.  
To ensure continuity in expert oversight by the consultants and for proper linkage of the DPR 
with the execution, the same consultants may be engaged for DPR and Post AoN activities. 

530 
 
14. 
Short listing of Vendors.     Consequent to AoN, the short listing of vendors for issue of 
RFP will be as per MoD guidelines issued vide MoD ID No. 4276/ D (Acq) /01 dated                 
01 June 2011. The RFP shall indicate Criteria for Vendor selection/ pre-qualification i.a.w. 
Appendix ‘R’ to Schedule-I to Chapter-II.  In addition, following additional requirements of 
certifications may be included as required:-

linked to the scope of work, e.g., Gartner Quadrant/ ISO 9001/ CMMi3/ AS 9100 or 
more (specifying development service/ acquisition models)/ ISO 27001. For Information 
Security and large value software intensive projects, preferably CMMi5 may be 
specified. 
 
(b) 
Requirement of compliance with international standards like IEEE (Institute of 
Electricals and Electronics Engineers standards association), ITU (International 
Telecommunication Union) etc may be included depending upon the nature/ type of 
project or solution required. 
 
(c) 
Where applicable, Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL 1 to EAL 7) of Common 
Criteria security evaluation Apr 2017 may be defined with a minimum 1 up to EAL5 for 
ICT projects. 
 
15. 
Request for Proposal (RFP).     The bids shall be solicited i.a.w. with Para 41 of   
Chapter-II and the RFP format at Schedule-I to Chapter-II and various provisions at Para 52 are 
to be suitably modified for including various features listed at Para 4 and 10 above in the RFP.  
Other aspects to be furnished in the RFP are as follows:- 
 
(a) 
Information Security.     In order to ensure mitigation of cyber/ information 
security threats in Systems and ICT procurement, selection of vendors with compliance 
to standards in information and cyber security is essential. Based on project specific 
requirement, the procurement process may focus on selection of trusted firms having 
established and proven credentials/ track record.  Information Security Guidelines for 
procurement of ICT components in the projects is provided in Appendix ‘B’ to aid 
suitable incorporation in the RFP. 
 
(b) 
Security Audit.     Security is of paramount importance and needs to be 
specifically included from the very conception of the project. The security checks need 
to be incorporated from the beginning to the end and additional cost be suitably catered. 
Bidder must commit to provide all support required to address any security concerns and 
share their source code developed for the concerned program (Source code means 
computer programming code in human readable form that is not suitable for machine 
execution without the intervening steps of interpretation or compilation), software and 
the equipment design details to the user or its designated agency for sanitization, 
verification and audit to confirm that their equipment and software is free from any 
malware, trapdoors or other facilities that may lead to security breaches. In cases where 
the source code is not a deliverable then the Bidder shall extend their available facilities 
for audit of the source code by the designated team of the customer.  Bidder must also 

531 
 
commit to security audit of developed systems by CERT-IN empanelled agencies. 
Inherent capability of DRDO may be utilised by seeking their assistance in the security 
audit as required. 
(c) 
Spyware/ Malware and National Security.     The TEC constituted i.a.w.      
Para 59 of Chapter II may also include reps from DRDO, as required.  If the system is 
being developed by DRDO, the member from DRDO shall not be from the developing 
laboratory. Spyware and Malware, if preloaded with electronic components and 
embedded systems presents extreme threat to Systems/ ICT systems and pose grave 
threat to national security. The scope for such vulnerabilities is to be examined and    
suitable pre-emptive measures and restrictions on sourcing of certain hardware items, if 
any, are to be incorporated in the RFP to enable the Technical Evaluation Committee to 
scrutinise the same during TEC process. All hardware platform where the critical 
portions of the software are executed (for e.g. encryption engine, networking stack etc) 
may be identified at DPR stage. Vendors/ OEMs may be required to share the PCB 
designs (schematics, gerber, datasheets etc) for security audit of these platforms. The 
tools and mechanisms to carry out the security audit of these platforms may be 
mentioned in for identification of these platforms and creating methodology for 
carrying out the security audit. In case, a need is felt to carryout Security Audit of other 
Systems and Sub Systems connected to the new System being procured, the same may 
also be included as part of Project requirement. 
 
(d) 
Selling customized solutions exclusively developed under the contract to some 
other country (replication) shall not be allowed due to security reasons. Any such sharing 
requires prior approval of the Buyer. 
 
(e) 
The details of all the active and high active components in the equipment being 
supplied along with their origin (i.e. OEM and country/place of manufacture) shall be 
provided as per Annexure-I to Appendix ‘B’. 
 
(f) 
Provisions for a joint working space to be setup and adequately staffed by the 
Bidder at a suitable place for ease of access and facilitating synergy of operations for 
furtherance of a project. Buyer/ Seller, as mutually agreed, shall be responsible for 
providing the necessary civil infrastructure and logistics for such work space. The 
specifics of the same shall be included in the RFP. 
 
(g) 
Entrance Task Verification and Exit (ETVX).    RFPs must layout 
Entrance, Task, Verification and Exit criteria clearly to benchmark the success of the 
project at each stage. 
 
16. 
Life Cycle Support and Maintenance 
 
(a) 
Seller should provide Maintenance Support for all Systems/ ICT projects/ 
products (system hardware/ software & other components/ equipment) for its entire 
life-cycle including warranty, maintenance, spares and technical support. 
 

532 
 
(b) 
To cater for life cycle support during implementation/ use of bespoke/ 
customized software projects, scope of maintenance support should include 
resolution of bugs, incorporation of user feedback and associated changes/ additional 
features/ refinements required for better exploitation of the software. 
 
(c) 
Warranty. 
Updates and Patches to the supplied software components, if 
any, should be provided at no additional cost by the developer to the user during the 
warranty period and if required during the lifetime of the Software. 
 
Update means a modification, correction or addition to the software or 
documentation, including updates and enhancement for Current Products that 
the Vendor generally make available to its customers as a part of support and 
maintenance under a vendor support and maintenance agreement without 
additional charge. The definition of “Update” excludes Upgrades. 
 
Patch(es) means additional programming code to be integrated with the 
Software to correct an error or alleviate its effects. It is a free set of changes to 
a computer program or it supporting data designed to update, fix or improve it. 
This includes fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs, with such patches 
usually being called bug-fixes and improving the functionality, usability or 
performance. 
 
(d) 
Any additional user defined upgrades may be clearly specified in the Supply 
Order and the cost implications to be factored in the initial cost of the project.  
 
Upgrade means an enhancement or addition to the Software other than an 
Update which the vendor does not make generally available to its customers 
as a part of support and maintenance under a vendor software support and 
maintenance agreement, but rather is only made commercially available for 
Current Products subject to payment of a separate incremental license fee, 
upgrade charge or as part of a subscription license fee. 
 
(e) 
Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC) & Annual Technical Support 
(ATS) 
 
(i) 
The project proposal shall have mandatory clause for minimum 05 
years of dedicated AMC/ ATS by the seller/ service provider.  The decision 
for entering into AMC/ ATS will be at the discretion of the buyer.  
 
(ii) 
AMC/ ATS may be contracted as a separate paid service between the 
buyer and the seller. AMC/ ATS may be integral part of the main contract. 
 
(iii) 
The period and the cost of ATS contract will cater for all upgrades/ 
updates/ integration of new technology into the existing/ original solution 
provided by the seller.  
 

533 
 
(iv) 
Software updates, bug-fixes are provided by the developer at no 
additional cost during the lifetime of the software.  ATS clause in the RFP 
may clearly distinguish and indicate upgrades and software maintenance 
aspects that developer must address during the period of ATS. For ATS 
calculation, scope for the maintenance of the software parts must be defined. 
 
17. 
Trials, ATP and Deliverables.     The scope of trials, ATP and the details of all the 
deliverables are to be clearly brought out in the RFP.  
 
(a) 
Trials.     It may be seen that the Systems/ ICT modules are functioning well 
in isolation but compiling them into a final product may be challenging over a period 
of time.  There would be a requirement to test and establish a Test Bed test if required 
and evaluate them deliberately which may require additional trial period and expertise 
for final migration.  These have to be adequately mentioned in RFP.  The detailed 
Trial Methodology to be worked out in detail by the Buyer and spelt clearly in RFP. 
 
(b) 
Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP).     There may be a requirement for a 
detailed ATP wherein some third party tools maybe required in some cases. Also, 
some specialist manpower and equipment may be required to be hired for trials and 
needs to be spelt out appropriately. 
 
18. 
Evaluation Criteria.     Based on the nature and complexity of project and scope of 
work envisaged, one of the following evaluation criteria may be used:- 
 
(a) 
Cost Based Selection (CBS) Method.     Cost Based evaluation criteria may 
be used to ascertain the lowest bidder where the requirement is basic or of highly 
standardized nature. Evaluation will be based on the cost of the complete asset or cost 
of service. 
 
(b)    Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) Method.      Method of evaluation 
may be adopted for complex/ high value projects by assigning suitable weightage to 
technical specifications/ superiority of solutions suggested, provided the weights to be 
assigned to technical features/ business criteria etc are objective and stated upfront in 
the RFP. The Technical and Financial proposals will be given the weightage in the 
ratio 60:40 with the weightage to Technical criteria not more than 60% depending 
upon scope of work/ complexity of project. The assessment of the technical 
capabilities of the bidders will be done  by TEC with  the Empowered Committee for 
Change Control (ECCC) as an independent committee and bids will be evaluated as 
follows:- 
 
(i) 
The technical proposal will be evaluated first and points will be allotted 
to each of the bidders. The minimum Technical Score (ST) to be obtained for 
considering financial proposal will be specified in RFP. Detailed and objective 
technical evaluation criteria out of a total score of 100, will be specified in 
RFP. A few technical criteria are indicated below:- 
 

534 
 
(aa) 
Firm’s experience in past similar ICT related projects. 
 
 
 
(ab) 
Domain expertise and project management consultancy. 
 
(ac) 
To what extent the performance, capacity, or functionality 
features, technology, Training methodology etc meet or exceed the levels 
specified in the performance/ functional SQRs. 
 
(ad) 
Experience and profile of team members in integrating multiple 
systems, setting up data centre and handling/ managing and monitoring 
projects implementation, software development etc. 
 
(ae) 
Quality of Technical Proposal in terms of key personnel, access to 
key 
equipment, 
site 
organization, 
safety, 
quality 
assurance, 
Implementation Schedule and any other activities as specified in technical 
parameter. 
 
(af) 
Assessment and procurement of hardware infrastructure, setting 
up data centre, cloud hosting etc. 
 
(ag) 
Experience of working in multiple systems integration, designing 
and implementation of ‘Internet of Things (IoT)’etc. 
 
(ah)  
Each technical feature may include sub criteria if required and the 
same needs to be specified. Deployment and logical information flow 
diagrams may be added to explain the use case scenario of all technical 
features. 
 
(aj) 
During the evaluation process, the evaluation committee may 
assign each desirable/preferred feature a whole number score as specified 
earlier. 
 
 
(ii) 
The financial evaluation will be done for only those proposals which 
obtain the minimum technical score. The Financial Scores (SF) of all 
proposals will be calculated as:- 
 
SF= 100 x FP min/FP, where 
 
SF= Financial score of proposal under consideration 
 
FP min = Price of lowest financial proposal 
 
FP = Price of proposal under consideration 
 
 
(iii) 
Proposals will be ranked according to their combined technical and 
financial scores as per following formula (for a 60:40 ratio):- 
 
S= ST x 0.6 + SF x 0.4, where 

535 
 
 
 
S= Final combined score 
 
ST=Technical Score 
 
SF= Financial Score 
 
 
(iv) 
The bidder achieving the highest combined Technical and Financial 
score(s) would be considered for the award of the contract. 
 
 
(v) 
The technical fields, details and specifications over which the bidder 
will be evaluated for calculating the Technical Score of the proposal. Such 
technical fields, details and specifications will be deliberated by the Collegiate 
during RFP vetting and approved by RFP Approving authorities. In such 
projects a due diligence may be done on the critical parameters of the project 
covering System Functionality, Technology, Specific implementation 
experience, Training methodology, performance in Proof of concept (in case 
PoC is planned), Certifications, Past experience of the vendor in executing 
similar assignments, size of those assignments, profile of team members and 
Project Methodology. The Technical Evaluation Committee in this case may 
have expertise or may have access to expertise to objectively evaluate and 
compare the various solutions components proposed by the bidders. 
 
(vi) 
QCBS details and the technical criteria for evaluation and example are 
included at Appendix ‘C’. 
 
(vii) 
The case may arise when the total score (Technical + Financial) of two 
bidders is same and the individual “Technical” and “Financial” scores are 
different. In such cases, the bidder with higher “Technical” score may be 
declared as L1.  
 
19. 
Indigenous Content (IC).  The products that have security implications are best 
procured through domestic developers. The IC requirement for ICT projects shall be at least 
10% more than those specified at Para 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of Chapter-I.  However the 
higher IC content need not be applicable for System projects. Notwithstanding the minimum IC 
mandated  as above, the main deliverable software of ICT and Systems projects like embedded 
software, system control solutions/ Algorithm’s, Front-end applications etc shall invariably be 
developed indigenously as brought out at Para 13 of Chapter-II of DAP.  In case it is not feasible 
to indigenously develop these software, the same shall be brought out in the SoC and specific 
approval shall be obtained. The indigenisation content shall be certified i.a.w. Para 23 of 
Chapter-I.  In the case of software, the self certification by the Bidder and certification by the 
statutory auditor of the Bidder shall certify that the software has been developed within India. If 
an Indian Bidder acquires the sole ownership of a proprietary software by way of acquisition/ 
one-time buy-out or any similar means and becomes the sole owner of Intellectual Property 
Rights (IPRs), such software can be considered as indigenous to the extent of the value of its 
utilization in the current contract, provided an undertaking is given that the Seller shall maintain 
the ownership of the software throughout the contract period. 
 

536 
 
20. 
Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs).     The terms of IPR should lay down the 
general terms for the assignment of property rights through patents, copyrights and 
trademarks.  Usually, expenditure for the development of foreground software is borne by 
the Buyer and IPRs of the foreground software and any other software or application developed 
as part of the project for delivery against the contract being paid by the Buyer would belong to 
the Buyer. Buyer may include suitable IPR clause so as to retain the complete ownership of such 
software solution/ end product (Bespoke/ Customized) developed under the project.  In cases 
where the Software is not a deliverable and user is provided a license and charged 
accordingly, then the IP resides with the Seller/ Technology Developer. Guidelines for 
incorporating IPR provisions during Systems/ ICT procurement are at Appendix ‘D’. 
 
21. 
Inter-services Collaboration/ Sharing of IPRs.     IPRs retained with any of the 
three services (Army, Navy, Air force, ICG and MoD) will deemed to be in joint ownership 
amongst all the three services without any need for formal permission of sharing the IPR. 
 
22. 
Field Evaluation Trials (FET).       For Systems projects and certain part of Hardware 
to be supplied with ICT projects where FET is necessary and, FET will be carried out on       
‘No cost-No commitment’ (NCNC) basis as per Para 66-71 of Chapter-II.  However, the 
software products ICT and certain elements of software of Systems projects that cannot be 
evaluated during FET, ‘Proof of Concept’ is to be demonstrated on ‘No cost-No commitment’ 
(NCNC) basis. 
 
23.     Proof of Concept (PoC).     The need to include provision for ‘Proof of Concept 
(PoC)’ in the evaluation process for the software projects should be considered carefully on 
case-to-case basis, and if decided upon, it should be undertaken in 2-3 clearly defined 
scenarios followed by structured evaluation of failure/ success. The evaluation process for 
demonstrating the PoC should be furnished in the RFP.  Wherever required, PoC may be 
done along with TEC, as a concurrent activity to save on time. 
24.   
Empowered Committee for Change Control (ECCC).     To examine, evaluate and 
review the changes in service during project execution phase, deviation in deliverables/ outputs 
as mid course corrections, accommodating minor variations in SQRs and need for upgradation 
of the project during its life cycle, after the finalisation of the contract. SHQs will constitute an 
Empowered Committee for Change Control (ECCC) headed by an officer of the rank of 
Lieutenant General or equivalent for projects value of more than Rs.1000 Cr and officer of the 
rank of Major General or equivalent for projects of value less than Rs.1000 Cr.  The members of 
the ECCC will be officers’ one rank/ grade below the rank of presiding officer from the user, 
line/ specialists and planning/ WE directorates and the financial advisor or his representative.  
 
25.    Change Management.     The service requirements set out in the Contract should take 
into account the SHQs long term (and not just the current) requirements, anticipating any 
changes in service that can reasonably be foreseen.  Accordingly, all foreseeable 
requirements and anticipated changes are to be incorporated in the RFP.  If necessary, in 
addition to seeking inputs from the prospective Bidders during RFI stage, the draft RFP may 
be shared with the shortlisted vendors as at Para 14 above and a pre-RFP discussion may be 
held with the vendors to seek their inputs. Any change in the scope of hardware and software 

537 
 
(without change in SQRs and AoN cost) arising as a result of pre-RFP discussion with the 
prospective Bidders are to be incorporated in the RFP. In addition a well developed change 
mechanism is to be incorporated in the contract to manage the residual unanticipated 
changes during the contract period. Thus, while ICT Application Enhancements (like 
software functionality enhancements etc) that are not conceived during the design stages, but 
are essential for successful utilisation of the application and those necessitated by change of 
policies of the Government/ Service Headquarters/ legislations and/ or due to change in the 
deployed techniques/ tactics by the adversaries may be progressed under Change in Service 
as under:- 
 
(a) 
Deviations in Outputs/ Deliverables.     There may be cases when during the 
project process, the deliverables of the project needs to be enhanced due to certain 
strategic requirements posed by the dynamic nature of the environment. The RFP 
may include clauses and clearly lay down procedure to handle such deviations in 
deliverables during the execution phase. This would provide flexibility to cater for 
technology change, upgrades, additional integration and provision for any deviations 
in deliverables which are out of the initial scope of work, to be paid as Paid Change 
Requests to the Bidder as part of the main contract. The ECCC after assessing and 
evaluating the requirements of Change will recommend each case for approval. The 
proposals for each Change in software/ hardware or cumulative value amounting up 
to plus or minus 15% of the basic value of software/hardware for ICT projects and 
10% of the basic value of System projects shall be approved under delegated power 
of SHQ. Change proposals for each change value beyond the delegated power or 
cumulative value beyond plus or minus 15% (10% for Systems projects) of the basic 
value of software/hardware respectively shall be submitted for CFA approval.   
 
(b) 
Accommodating Minor Variations.    Supply of higher specification 
products due to non availability of same specifications as ordered may be accepted, 
provided the seller submits a certificate from the OEM that the ordered specifications 
of the product have been upgraded and there is no addition/ reduction in price. 
 
26. 
Upgradation.     As majority of the Systems and ICT projects would require upgradation 
during their life cycle, upgradation through OEM/ original developer/ System Integrator who 
was the main Supplier is inevitable. The requirement of upgradation of software and hardware 
(where required) is to be periodically evaluated by SHQ and if considered necessary, the scope 
of upgradation is to be finalised.  Based on the financial implications and preferred route (either 
under OCPP under Chapter X or provisions of this Chapter), a case for AoN for upgradation 
through the OEM/ original developer/ System Integrator who was the main Supplier (on STE 
basis) under the financial powers of SHQ/ MoD as relevant, shall be taken up with respective 
AoN granting authority.

INFORMATION SECURITY GUIDELINES FOR PROCUREMENT OF 
ICT GOODS AND SERVICES 
 
1. 
ICT projects are complex systems integration projects which have hardware, system 
software (Operating systems/hypervisor/virtualization layer etc) and application software (both 
off-the-shelf and custom developed in various programming languages). The various guidelines 
issued from Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) and other relevant 
Government agencies may be referred.  
 
2. 
“Malicious code or Malware” is defined as a computer program attached to or a section of 
code and hidden within the software that performs a function unauthorized by the OEM’s 
published documentation and is intended to damage/conduct detrimental activity.  Malware is 
generally in the form of Trojans, viruses, worms, root kits, spyware, code scripts, active content 
etc.  It is also known as “computer contaminant” in legal parlance.  Malicious code could be 
introduced into information and communication systems, to be exploited by external or internal 
agents to do one or more of the following:- 
 
(a) 
Disrupt the functioning of the system at a critical juncture. 
 
(b) 
Provide a backdoor entry for leakage of information from the system. 
 
3. 
Hence, from a cyber threat perspective, it is important that clear guidelines are laid down 
on the cyber/ information security threat mitigation approach which should address the risks and 
also be implementable and verifiable. 
 
4. 
The approach followed by leading IT manufacturing companies against cyber threats is 
to control the firmware installed in the IT components which is the “intelligence” in the 
hardware that is targeted by malicious code.  The sub-systems like controller cards and hard 
disks get shipped with the OEM’s approved firmware or microcode version while configuring 
the system before delivery or installation.  These firmware and microcode are common for all 
the countries across the world and the files are usually available on OEM’s website. 
 
5. 
In addition, it is also important to track the malicious code in systems during the project 
lifecycle as follows:- 
 
(a) 
OEMs of the hardware can certify that their products do not have malicious code 
embedded in them when the products are dispatched from their premises.  However, it is 
possible that malicious code could be introduced into the hardware and software systems 
after they have been dispatched from the OEM premises or even later on during the 
operational phase, through unauthorized patches/ upgrades. 
 
(b) 
The Bidder will therefore be responsible to MoD during installation, warranty 
and support period, to mitigate the risks due to malicious code and security vulnerabilities 

540 
 
in all the products supplied by them.  Bidders in turn, should have the required 
agreements with the OEMs. 
 
(c) 
The supplier will take an undertaking from OEM stating that the OEM has not 
kept any back-door or a kill switch in the firmware intentionally or unintentionally.  The 
supplier will take the responsibility of ensuring that any such back-door or kill switch is 
not present in the firmware of the ICT equipment being supplied. 
 
6. 
Following features should be included in the RFP for all the ICT and Systems related 
projects.  In case of High Risk projects, additional information on the origin of the equipment/ 
sub system/ components as necessary Bidder to mitigate malware risks, may be sought as 
required. 
 
(a) 
A certificate should be obtained by the Buyer from the Seller stating that all 
known security issues and malware have been addressed in the products including 
hardware/ firmware at the time of supplying the hardware/ software products.  The Seller 
is also required to include similar contractual clauses in their contract with their sub-
vendors and submit the Certificates while offering the equipment for acceptance 
inspection. 
 
(b) 
If active components are not to be sourced from a specific OEM(s)/ source(s) that 
are opined to be not trustworthy, or if the components are to be sourced only from a few 
reliable OEM(s)/ source(s) (in which case at least 3 to 4 such sources are to be indicated), 
such details are to be clearly stated in the RFP. Further, details of all the active 
components in the equipment being supplied along with their origin (i.e., OEM and 
country/ place of manufacture) are to be provided by the Bidder as per Annexure-I to 
Appendix ‘B’.  The same is to be verified during the Acceptance. 
 
(c) 
Various measures adopted/ instituted by Bidder for Information security and 
Subversion attacks/ Spyware/ Malware and to ensure that the equipment being supplied 
would be free of malicious code as confirmed in the Malicious Code Certificate to be 
specified in detail as per Annexure-II to Appendix ‘B’. The same to be verified by the 
TEC. 
 
(d) 
The Bidder is to provide documents indicating the patch level update of the 
system. 
 
(e) 
If any security issue(s) are not addressed in the hardware/ firmware/ software at 
the time of supply and are exposed after their supply during the operational phases, the 
Seller should provide an undertaking that such exposed issues shall be immediately 
addressed by exercising the work-around before solutions/ patches for the same are 
available.  Once the solutions/ patches are available for the same, those should be applied 
at priority to the supplied hardware/ firmware/ software.  In such a case, the Buyer may 
exercise the discretion to accept such a product provided such security issues do not 
interfere with the functionality/ integrity of the system. 
 

541 
 
(f) 
The seller should also undertake to provide security patches and updates to 
address subsequent vulnerabilities during the installation, warranty and support period of 
the equipment provided OEM has not declared end of support for the same. 
 
(g) 
Based on the criticality of the projects, Bidders may be asked to provide on-site 
testing of firmware by OEM using methods like Diverse Double-Compiling (DDC) etc 
for ensuring integrity of the firmware. 
 
7. 
In addition to the above, it would be desirable that the supply chain for sourcing of 
imported active components is suitably camouflaged/ secured to ensure that the component 
suppliers are unable to determine the ultimate utilization/ destination of the components 
supplied by them.  Measures for this should include buying from multiple vendors, not issuing 
any custom duty certificate, end user certificate etc. Further an undertaking may be obtained 
from primary vendor that the end user will not be disclosed to the sub vendor. (This provision 
would reduce the risk to the targeted malware insertion.  However, this may be of limited utility 
against general malware that a few companies may routinely insert in all the active components 
manufactured. Further, it may result in increased monetary cost. This approach may not be 
feasible in case of certain niche technology products, which may mandatorily require ‘end-use’ 
certificates for getting export permission from their country of origin). 
 
8. 
Notwithstanding, the provisions specified elsewhere in the Security Guidelines, the 
Bidder will be overall responsible for all cyber/ information security related aspects pertaining 
to the Systems Projects & ICT goods and services and will be the single point of contact for 
addressing all Cyber/ information security related issues for the goods and services supplied by 
him as part of the contract.  It will be the responsibility of the Bidder to enter into such 
agreements/ contracts with the OEMs as may be necessary to ensure that all cyber/ information 
security aspects are addressed holistically and comprehensively.  The Bidder will provide list of 
tests conducted by OEM or an accredited certification agency along with list of such test reports 
for the Systems Projects & ICT goods and services provided as part of contract.  The Malicious 
Code Certificate as per Annexure-III to Appendix ‘B’ is to be provided by the OEMs and 
Bidder/ Seller. 
 
Information Security Aspects Related to Systems and ICT Hardware 
 
9. 
From a cyber-security threat perspective, Systems and ICT hardware can be broadly 
categorized as follows:- 
 
(a) 
Inert Components.     Which have no electronic circuitry like power & other 
cables, connectors, racks, chassis hardware etc. 
 
(b) 
Passive Components.      Sub-systems/ PCBs which have electronic circuitry, 
but no intelligence in terms of software/ firmware/ microcode like backplanes, keyboard, 
mouse, monitor, normal printer etc. 
 
(c) 
Active Components.     Sub systems/ PCBs which have device-specific 
intelligence that is built into firmware/ microcode like controller cards, hard disk drives, 

542 
 
intelligent printers with smart features and memory, motherboards server management 
modules etc. 
 
(d) 
High Active Components.     Appliances with a high level of intelligence built 
into firmware/ microcode, embedded OS & software. 
 
10. 
Following may be considered to mitigate information Security Risks in Systems and ICT 
hardware:- 
 
(a) 
Bidder’s mitigation plan to ensure no malicious first party code in the product 
and adequate provisions/ steps incorporated in the design and architecture to mitigate the 
effects. 
 
(b) 
Identify critical projects and procurements, which are vital to the organization 
and whose disruption can cause catastrophic failure. This step is basically to keep the 
scope of validation to a manageable level. 
 
(c) 
Shortlist the trusted OEMs, who have clear and verifiable processes in managing 
their suppliers and supply chains, both from quality and cyber security threat 
perspectives. 
 
(d) 
At the RFP stage, specifically mention the components/ categories out of those 
mentioned at Para 8 above, which will be tested by the customer for cyber threats, which 
may be done in the OEM's or an accredited lab premises. 
 
(e) 
Obtain malicious code certificate from OEM and Bidder as specified in 
Annexure-III to Appendix ‘B’. 
 
(f) 
At the time of delivery, the OEM will provide details of the firmware/ microcode 
installed in each of the components specified in Para8 above.  If required, Buyer may ask 
for the firmware/ microcode to be reloaded in the OEM's service centers. 
 
(g) 
Step(s) as above be carried out every time the component is replaced or 
upgraded. 
 
Information Security Aspects Related to Software Projects 
 
11. 
In case of software projects including bespoke software development, the following 
information should be supplied by the Seller:- 
 
(a) 
List of changes being made to Operating System due to software installation.  
 
(b) 
List of dependencies including software components and its DLL files. 
 
(c) 
List of processes including 'child processes' and service/ daemon being created in 
the Operating System.

QUALITY BASED SELECTION (QCBS) METHOD 
 
1. 
Selection of Service Providers.         The selection of service provider/ contractor will 
be done as per any of the following methods as considered appropriate with the approval of 
CFA as per delegation of financial powers in vogue. 
 
(a) 
Cost Based Selection (CBS) Method.     Under normal circumstances, this 
method of evaluation shall be used for services which are of generic and recurring nature 
for which standard operating procedures have been prescribed along with minimum 
qualifying criteria.  The service provider will be selected on CBS/ L1 basis only. 
 
(b) 
Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) Method.     Quality Cost Based 
System. This method of selection shall be used for highly technical projects/ services/ 
assignments which have high impact and hence it is essential to engage highly skilled 
agency which offers their professional services. Output of such services is highly 
dependent on the expertise of the service provider. For such services, weightage needs to 
be given to higher technical standards, while finalizing the prices.  The service provider 
will be selected on L1-T1 basis. 
 
2. 
Demand Initiation & Approval Under CBS. 
Demand will be initiated and 
approved as per the provisions. CFA will be determined as per the delegation of financial 
powers in vogue for selection of service provider. 
 
3. 
 Demand Initiation & Approval Under QCBS. 
  Selection of service provider under 
QCBS implies that the evaluation of bids will be done on the basis of both “Non-price 
Attributes” and “Price Attributes”. The Non-price attributes comprises of parameters related to 
technical competency/ managerial ability such as availability of qualified personnel and support 
staff experience of key personnel or availability of in-house QA practices etc. The Price attribute 
is related to the price quoted by the bidders. The demand approval process in such cases would 
inter-alia require compliance of following:- 
 
(a)  
RFP will be prepared and issued with concurrence of finance.  Standard format of 
RFP would be appropriately modified to incorporate following:- 
 
(i)  
Details of work or service to be performed by the contractor. 
 
(ii) 
The facilities and the inputs that would be provided to the contractor by 
the SHQ. 
 
(iii)  
Eligibility and qualification criteria to be met by the contractor for 
performing the required work or service. 
 

549 
 
(iv) 
The statutory and contractual obligations to be complied with by the 
contractor. 
 
(v) 
Suitable evaluation criteria wherein weightage of “Non-price Attributes” 
and “Price Attributes” to be mentioned upfront. 
 
(vi) 
In case of outsourcing consultancy services, Terms of Reference (TOR) 
following will be included in the RFP:- 
 
(aa) 
Purpose/ objective of the assignment; 
 
(ab) 
Detailed scope of work; 
 
(ac) 
Expected input of key professionals (number of experts, kind of 
expertise required). 
 
(ad) 
Proposed schedule for completing the assignment. 
 
(ae) 
Reports/ deliverables required from the service provider. 
 
(af) 
Background material, previous records etc available and to be 
provided to the service provider. 
 
(ag) 
Procedure for review of the work of service provider after award 
of contract. 
 
(vii)  Standard formats for technical proposal. 
 
(b)  
Pre-bid Meeting. 
A pre-bid meeting will invariably be prescribed in the RFP 
for selection of service provider under QCBS. The date and time for such a meeting may 
normally be after 15 to 30 days of issue of RFP and should be specified in the RFP itself. 
During this meeting, the scope of assignment, responsibilities of either parties or other 
details may be clearly explained to the prospective bidders so that there is no ambiguity 
later on at the time of submission of technical/ financial bids. Where some significant 
changes are made in the terms/ scope of RFP as a result of pre bid meeting or otherwise 
considered necessary by the Buyer, a formal Corrigendum to RFP may be issued. In such 
cases, it should be ensured that after issue of Corrigendum, reasonable time is available 
to the bidders to prepare/ submit their bid. If required, the time for preparation and 
submission of bids may be extended, suitably. 
 
(c)  
Two bid system will be followed for all cases irrespective of the cost. CNC will 
be conducted for all cases under QCBS. 
 
(d) 
CFA will be determined as per the delegation of financial powers in vogue for 
selection of service provider. 
 

550 
 
4. 
Evaluation under Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) Method. The 
weightage should be decided by the Collegiate prior to issue of the RFP and should be 
maintained in sealed cover thereafter till opening of bids and L1-T1 decision matrix 
preparation. 
 
(a) 
Under QCBS, the proposals will be allotted technical and financial weightage 
depending upon the nature of assignment. 
 
(b) 
Proposal with the lowest cost, evaluated as per the provision of this Manual, may 
be given a financial score of 100 and other proposals given financial scores that are 
inversely proportional to their evaluated cost.  
 
(c) 
The total score, both technical and financial, shall be obtained by weighing the 
quality and cost scores and adding them up. The proposed weightage for technical and 
financial parameters for each project mentioned in Para 2 of this chapter shall be specified 
in the RFP. A few technical criteria are indicated below:- 
 
(i) 
Firm’s experience in past similar ICT related projects. 
 
(ii) 
Domain expertise and project management consultancy. 
 
(iii) 
To what extent the performance, capacity, or functionality features, 
technology, Training methodology etc meet or exceed the levels specified in the 
performance/ functional SQRs. 
 
(iv) 
Experience and profile of team members in integrating multiple systems, 
setting up data centre and handling/ managing and monitoring projects 
implementation, software development etc. 
 
(v) 
Quality of Technical Proposal in terms of key personnel, access to key 
equipment, site organization, safety, quality assurance, Implementation Schedule 
and any other activities as specified in technical parameter. 
 
(vi) 
Assessment and procurement of hardware infrastructure, setting up data 
centre, cloud hosting etc. 
 
(vii) 
Experience of working in multiple systems integration, designing and 
implementation of ‘Internet of Things (IoT)’ etc. 
 
(viii) Each technical feature may include sub criteria if required and the same 
needs to be specified. 
 
(ix) 
During the evaluation process, the evaluation committee may assign each 
desirable/ preferred feature a whole number score as specified earlier. 
 

551 
 
(d) 
Highest Points Basis.   On the basis of the combined weighted score for 
technical and financial, the service provider shall be ranked in terms of the total score 
obtained. The proposal obtaining the highest total combined score in evaluation of 
quality and cost will be ranked as H-1 followed by the proposals securing lesser marks as 
H-2, H-3 etc. The proposal securing the highest combined marks and ranked H-1 will be 
invited for negotiations, if required and shall be recommended for award of contract. As 
an example, the following procedure can be followed. In a particular case of selection of 
service provider, it was decided to have minimum qualifying marks for technical 
qualifications as 75 and the weightage of the technical bids and financial bids was kept 
as 60:40. In response to the RFP, 3 proposals, A, B & C were received. The TEC 
awarded 75, 80 and 90 marks respectively. The minimum qualifying marks were 75. All 
the 3 proposals were, therefore, found technically suitable and their financial proposals 
were opened after notifying the date and time of bid opening to the successful 
participants. The CNC examined the financial proposals and evaluated the quoted prices 
as under:- 
 
Proposal 
 
Evaluated Cost 
A 
Rs 120 
B 
Rs 100 
C 
Rs 110 
 
(e) 
Using the formula LEC/ EC, where LEC stands for lowest evaluated cost and EC 
stands for evaluated cost, the committee gave them the following points for financial 
proposals:- 
 
Proposal  
 
Evaluated Cost 
Cost Marks 
A  
Rs. 120 
(100/120) x 100 = 83 points 
B 
Rs. 100 
(100/100) x 100 = 100 points 
C 
Rs. 110 
(100/110) x 100 = 91 points 
 
(f) 
In the QCBS evaluation, thereafter, the evaluation committee calculated the 
combined technical and financial score as under:- 
 
Proposal  
 
Evaluated 
Cost 
Cost Marks Combined Marks 
 
A 
Rs. 120 
83 points 
(75 x 0.60) + (83 x 0.40) = 78.2 pts 
B 
Rs. 100 
100 points 
(80 x 0.60) + (100 x 0.40) = 88 pts 
C 
Rs. 110 
91 points 
(90 x 0.60) + (91 x 0.40) = 90.4 pts 
 
 
 
 

552 
 
(g) 
The three proposals in the combined technical and financial evaluation were 
ranked as under: 
 
Proposal   
 
Evaluated Cost Cost 
Marks 
Combined Marks 
 
Rank 
A 
Rs. 120 
83 points 
(75 x 0.60) + (83 x 
0.40) = 78.2 pts 
H3 
B 
Rs. 100 
100 points 
(80 x 0.60) + (100 x 
0.40) = 88 pts 
H2 
C 
Rs. 110 
91 points 
(90 x 0.60) + (91 x 
0.40) = 90.4 pts 
H1 
 
(h) 
Proposal C at the evaluated cost of Rs. 110 was, therefore, declared as winner 
and recommended for negotiations/approval, to the competent authority.

CHAPTER IX 
 
LEASING 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

554 
 
CHAPTER IX 
 
LEASING 
 
1. 
Definition of a Lease. 
A lease is a contract outlining the terms under which one 
party agrees to rent Goods owned by another party. It guarantees the lessee, use of an asset 
and guarantees the lessor, regular payments for a specified period in exchange. Both the 
lessee and the lessor face consequences if they fail to uphold the terms of the contract. Lease 
is a legal and binding contract, set forth in the form of an agreement.  
 
2. 
Leasing is introduced as another category for acquisition in addition to the existing 
‘Buy’ and ‘Make’ acquisition categories as it provides for an innovative technique for 
financing of equipment. Leasing provides means to possess and operate the asset without 
owning the asset and is useful to substitute huge initial capital outlays with periodical rental 
payments.  
 
3. 
Leasing would be permitted in two sub categories i.e. Lease (Indian), where Lessor is 
an Indian entity and is the owner of the asset, and Lease (Global) which refers to lease of 
equipment from foreign or Indian Lessors. Lease (Indian) would be the preferred category. 
 
4. 
Cases for Lease. 
Cases where lease of equipment may be preferred are:- 
 
(a) 
Where procurement is not feasible due to time constraint. 
 
(b) 
Where the asset/capability is needed for a specific time or would be under 
utilised if procured. 
 
(c) 
Where smaller numbers of assets are needed and administrative /maintenance 
infrastructure expenditure would be high. 
 
(d) 
When lease rentals are a better option compared to a one-time acquisition cost. 
 
(e) 
To gain experience for operational exploitation of equipment. 
 
(f) 
Due to operational necessity. 
 
5. 
New unused equipment, as well as previously used equipment could be procured 
under lease.   
 
6. 
Advantage of Lease Model.  For the MoD, the lease enables use of equipment 
without making a large initial Capital outlay, mitigate effect of equipment obsolescence, 
faster acquisition of capability, and reduced administrative costs. For the Lessor, a lease 
instrument provides a way to offset benefits of equipment depreciation for better returns on 
capital, against assured returns from a Govt contract. 

555 
 
 
7. 
Types of Leases. 
SHQ, while examining the cases, may examine the applicability 
of appropriate lease type, from the following types, with due justification:-  
 
(a) 
Operating Lease. An arrangement where Lessee (MoD) uses the asset for a 
specific period and makes rental payments for the use of the asset, but does not gain 
ownership rights over the asset. At the conclusion of the arrangement, or at 
predetermined times during the terms of the lease, the asset may be acquired by the 
MoD (the Lessee) for an agreed-to price set at the beginning of the lease (the residual 
value). Alternatively, the asset/equipment can be returned to the lessor at the end of 
the lease term, meeting certain return conditions, which are similarly negotiated at the 
onset of the lease.  
 
(i) 
An operating lease could be Dry/Wet or Damp lease. While in a Dry 
lease only an asset is leased, in a Wet lease arrangement a lessor provides the 
asset, crew, maintenance and insurance to the Lessee.  
 
(b) 
Finance Lease.  Operates similar to a loan, as Lessee (MoD) pays for the 
entire value of the asset over the term of the lease. At the conclusion of the 
arrangement, the MoD (the Lessee) can take ownership of the asset for nominal 
predetermined consideration or return it to the Lessor.  
 
8. 
Examination of Lease vs Acquisition. 
A lease involving military assets allows 
MoD to enter into a long-term commitment to pay for use of military assets over time and/or 
potentially acquire these assets at the end of the lease period. It is important that specific 
goals/objectives for acquiring assets on lease are clearly laid out, examined and understood in 
detail. This is necessary to finalise technical requirements, financial requirements as well as 
the desired duration of the lease. Where possible these goals/objectives should be shared with 
the industry in RFI, LOR and RFP stages. A cost benefit analysis is required to be undertaken 
and included in the Statement of Case for all cases. 
 
9. 
Traditional acquisition process involves dealing directly with Original Equipment 
Manufacturers (OEMs), which provide the underlying capability to meet the SHQ 
requirements. However, lease arrangements may also include additional stakeholders, such as 
Government of the OEM and third-party financiers, who provide access to cost effective 
financing to the Lessor.  
 
(a) 
In commercial leasing industry, it is common for Lessors to be an independent 
third party that has partnered with OEMs/Suppliers.   
 
(b) 
A final lease contract may require coordination between a Leasing firm, its 
financiers, OEM and/or Government of the OEM.   
 

556 
 
10. 
Generally, a longer-term lease may provide best value for money, compared to a 
short(er) term lease.   
 
11. 
Maintenance Philosophy. 
In certain lease arrangements (for example in Dry lease 
for aircraft, or a Finance lease), the lessee (i.e. MoD) may require to undertake maintenance 
of the equipment under lease. In such cases, the Maintenance Philosophy to be adopted for the 
lease case must also be examined at RFI/formulation of LOR stage. If sought from the Lessor, 
maintenance may be subject of a separate agreement from the main lease agreement.  
 
12. 
Additional Considerations for Lease Cases. 
 
(a) 
Applicable to Lease (Global) Cases only. A lease of military product 
involves 
several 
nuances 
unique 
to 
the 
domain, 
including 
financing, 
licensing/approvals by the Government of the OEM domicile, care/custody & control 
over assets, return conditions, return of assets to an entity approved by a Government 
of the OEM domicile, etc. The parties also need to consider respective accounting 
rules, applicable operating regulations and their application to the parties.  
 
(b) 
Insurance and liability are important safeguards/components of a lease 
contract. These aspects need to be carefully considered, amongst options to self-
insure, or procure commercial insurance, and their applicability to lease payments. 
 
(c) 
These unique complexities require proactive and constant communication 
between the various parties and stakeholders, given the complex subject matter and 
large number of stakeholders, discussions with the OEM community should be started 
as early as possible in order to allow for timely delivery of the assets. 
 
(d) 
Lease agreements have to specify conditions of re-delivery/return of the asset 
to the Lessor. Such conditions typically specify physical condition of asset at the time 
of return, asset maintenance records, special checks – if any. 
 
13. 
Equipment Modification/Refit/Upgrade to Available Equipment. There may be 
cases, where equipment directly available for lease, may need modifications (or a refit or an 
upgrade) for use by the Services. At the end of lease period, before re-delivery of the 
equipment to the Lessor, such modifications would need to be reversed. Due to this, need for 
modifications, if any, must be carefully examined in a lease case. Payments for such 
modifications / de-modifications must be included in the contract. 
 
Note: Modifications/upgrade of leased equipment, after commencement of lease will 
be outside the scope of this paragraph. Lease terms in such conditions will be 
negotiated separately.  
 
 
 

557 
 
Special Terms in Relation to Lease   
 
14. 
Conditions Precedent (CP). 
 
(a) 
The Conditions Precedent (CP) to delivery under any lease agreement are those 
pre-conditions, whether factual, documentary or otherwise, which must be satisfied 
before the relevant party is obliged to proceed with delivery and acceptance, and the 
lease term commences. In most leases, it is necessary for both parties to satisfy certain 
conditions precedent. In the event of failure of one party to satisfy any of the 
conditions precedent, the non-defaulting party is entitled not to proceed with delivery 
or acceptance of the equipment, or alternatively may agree to proceed on the basis of 
the waiver or deferral of the relevant CP.  
 
(b) 
Some examples of CP are:-  
 
(i) 
Payments (security deposits, commitment fee, first rent, etc.).   
 
(ii) 
Provision/creation of letters of guarantee, credit or other credit 
enhancement instruments in place.  
 
(iii) 
Receipt of the insurance certificate and letter of undertaking.  
 
(iv) 
Receipt of certain key documents (e.g. deregistration, Power of 
Attorney, proof of legal capacity to enter into the lease with supporting legal 
opinion, board approval resolutions).  
 
(v) 
No total loss of equipment.  
 
(vi) 
Lessee satisfactory inspection of equipment/aircraft and documentation 
within agreed timeframe.   
 
(vii) 
Equipment being in agreed delivery condition. 
 
15. 
Insurance. 
Due to peculiar nature of a lease contract, insurance of the asset is 
important parameter. From the perspective of a Lessor, assumption of risk associated with 
operation and use of equipment during the lease period and the consequent liability is a factor 
for consideration in a lease contract.  There are two aspects to insurance that need 
consideration.   
 
(a) 
Hull Insurance (Main Equipment Insurance). Hull insurance provides 
coverage for the value of the Lessor’s asset in the event of physical damage to, or loss, 
of the equipment or aircraft (including records and removed parts/engine).  
 

558 
 
(b) 
Liability Insurance.  Liability insurance provides coverage for general legal 
liability, including Third Party. This also includes loss, damage, injury and death to 
Third Party and its property.  
 
16. 
Non-Insurable Assets and Lessor Indemnity. Not all the equipment for use by the 
military may be insured by the insurance companies. In such cases, the Hull Insurance and 
Liability will be covered under existing provisions for operation of military equipment as per 
following guidelines:-  
 
(a) 
All equipment taken on lease will be ‘Brought on Charge’ by the SHQ, before 
first use. Any loss or damage to the equipment during use will be written off as per 
existing procedure (with reference to Rules 33 to 38 of GFRs 2017, as amended and as 
per DFPDS, as amended). The cost of write off, will be reimbursed to the Lessor as 
per conditions of lease contract.  
 
(b) 
After the leased equipment is taken on charge, any liability arising out of its 
use will be that of the Lessee. Third party claims related to injury or death, direct or 
indirect loss of assets, will be paid by the Lessee as per existing rules on such claims 
including ex-gratia payments.   
 
17. 
Insurance and Liability in Military Contracts. 
Responsibility to insure a leased 
asset is that of the Lessee. Accordingly, MoD (Acquisition Wing)/SHQ may coordinate lease 
insurance terms and conditions with insurance companies. Where it is feasible for the Lessor 
to obtain the insurance, such an option may be exercised.   
 
18. 
Commitment Fee. 
The Commitment Fee is paid by the Lessee as a consideration 
for the Lessor to take the equipment/aircraft off the market, for subsequently providing them 
to the Lessee as a part of lease agreement. It can be paid through:- 
 
(a) 
An advance payment (up to 15% as per provisions of DAP 2020), and/or.  
 
(b) 
Increased rate of initial payments. 
 
(c) 
As per payment schedule agreed during CNC.   
 
19. 
Payment Terms. 
 
(a) 
The payment periodicity may be quarterly, six-monthly or annual payments. A 
different payment periodicity could also be agreed depending on the case.  
 
(b) 
The payments for equipment being leased will normally be after the lease 
period. To illustrate, for quarterly payment terms, the 1st quarterly payment will be 
made in the 4th month, after the equipment has been used for the first three months. 

559 
 
Different payment terms, such as payments made in advance of the lease period could 
also be agreed depending on the case.  
 
20. 
Brought on Charge.  For accounting purposes, the leased equipment will be 
‘Brought on Charge’ by the SHQ before being put to first use. In case of damage to the 
equipment, the cost will be written off as per existing procedure. The write off cost will be 
reimbursed to the Lessor as per the terms of Lease Contract.  
 
21. 
Graded Penalties. 
For proper performance of the lease, the lease agreement may 
have graded penalties linked to performance metrics for partial/full default on lease 
agreement. Various payment options could be used, such as advance percentage, stage 
payment, payments at the end of agreed periodicity, after the asset has been utilised as per 
agreed performance metrics. Same need to be defined in the SoC for seeking AoN.

(xiii) Definition of any key terms that will apply in the lease, including 
eligible maintenance events for maintenance reserves reimbursement.   
 
(xiv) Regulatory/registration regime.  
 
(xv) 
Governing law.  
 
(xvi) Confidentiality.  
 
(xvii) Tentative time schedule of the leasing process.  
 
(d) 
The RFI should seek the following inputs:- 
 
(i) 
Details regarding equipment capabilities.  
 
(ii) 
Type of lease (Refer Paragraph 7 above).   
 
(iii) 
Details required for determining the cost of lease.  
 
(iv) 
Scope, depth and range of lease.  
 
(v) 
Any Conditions Precedent.  
 
(vi) 
Any special conditions of lease.  
 
(vii) 
References of applicable statutory law, rule, regulations, including 
national/federal guidelines, as applicable to the asset and conditions of lease. 
 
(e) 
Adequate time should be given to the vendors, for a structured response to the 
RFI and for interaction. 
 
(f) 
The RFI should also ask details about the vendors as per Appendix A to 
Chapter II of DAP 2020.   
 
(g) 
After uploading/sharing of RFI with potential respondents, interactions may be 
planned by the Empowered Committee. After due interactions, vendors may be given 
sufficient time to respond to the RFI. 
 
24. 
Letter of Intent. 
In certain cases, SHQ may identify equipment during 
multinational interactions/exercises with friendly militaries. Use of equipment may also have 

562 
 
emerged during inter-governmental interactions with friendly countries. In such cases, instead 
of an RFI, the MoD will issue a ‘Letter of Intent (LoI)’, broadly encompassing the 
requirements above. 
 
25. 
Identification of Equipment and Operational Demonstration.   Due to 
considerations placed at paragraphs 9 to 24 above, extensive interactions may be required 
with all the vendors/stake holders. Based on responses to the RFI, and vendor interactions, 
the SHQ will identify suitable equipment for lease, as well as finalise a list of potential 
Lessor’s. Same will be approved at the level of PSO at SHQ. Operational demonstration may 
be carried out in the following cases:- 
 
(a) 
In cases, where operational performance of the equipment is known, or such 
equipment is already is in use by the SHQ and lease is being considered for additional 
quantities, or where such an equipment was used in the past, requirement of an 
Operational Demonstration can be dispensed with.  
 
(b) 
Where the performance and utility of the equipment has been observed during 
an exercise with a friendly foreign force, or during a bilateral/multilateral event, 
requirement of an Op Demo may be dispensed with. 
 
(c) 
In cases where equipment performance has not been checked before, SHQ may 
seek Op Demo of the equipment by the Lessor, as a part of the RFI process. 
 
26. 
Lease Operational Requirements (LOR).  The 
LOR 
defines 
the 
operational 
capability sought and any special conditions of lease. The LOR must lay down user 
requirements in a comprehensive and unambiguous manner. LOR of classified nature will be 
shared after a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). The LOR will be ratified by the SEPC.  
 
Note: While determining the LORs, the SEPC will be guided by user requirement 
and capability of equipment available for lease. In this sense, the LORs cannot be 
futuristic in nature and will be governed by capability available for lease. 
 
27. 
Acceptance of Necessity (AoN). 
In order to seek AoN, a SoC would be prepared 
as per suggestive format placed as Appendix A to this chapter. A cost benefit analysis is 
required to be undertaken and included in the SoC for all cases. The LOR and draft RFP will 
be attached along with the SoC. AoN will be sought based on the total value of the lease 
rental cost (including insurance costs, if any) over the period of lease. AoN for lease cases 
upto ₹ 500 Cr would be accorded by the DPB (after being recommended by the SPB) and 
cases above ₹ 500 Cr by the DAC (after being recommended by the DPB). The SoC will be 
processed as per provisions of Chapter II of DAP 2020. Validity of the AoN will be as per the 
DAP 2020. AoN would lapse for all cases where the RFP for approved quantity is not issued 
within the original validity period of AoN. In such cases, the SHQ would have to seek fresh 
AoN with due justification for not issue of RFP. For cases where the RFP is issued within the 
original validity period of AoN and later retracted for any reason, the AoN would continue to 

563 
 
remain valid, as long as the original decision remains unchanged, and provided the 
subsequent RFP is issued within a period not exceeding the original validity period of the 
AoN from the date of retraction of original RFP. The validity of AoN would be six months 
from the date of issue of Minutes of Meeting of the AoN according authority.  Subsequent to 
the accord of AoN, the broad details of the projects/procurement would be hosted on the 
MoD and SHQ websites within one week of issue of minutes keeping security aspects in 
mind. Additional vendors, who did not respond to the RFI, may express interest for receipt of 
RFP and submission of bid, within four weeks from the date of publication of details on these 
websites. 
 
28. 
Lease cases being progressed with DPSUs or under Inter Governmental Agreements 
will not be treated as Single Vendor Cases.   
 
29.

Explanatory Note 
Lease of military assets involves several nuances unique to the domain. Type/nature of military 
equipment, coordination with multiple stakeholders including leasing firms, its financiers, OEMs, 
Govt of OEMs, insurers and others. Unique complexities of military leasing require constant and 
proactive coordination and communication between all the stakeholders, which can help design a 
leasing solution that is optimized for the particular goals and objective of the MoD. Accordingly, 
this annexure is meant to provide only as guidance to the Empowered Committee for a sample 
lease contract. The Empowered Committee should exercise flexibility to enter into a deal that 
provides the most optimal solution for all parties and addresses the specific goals and objectives 
of the MoD/SHQ.

CHAPTER X 
 
OTHER CAPITAL PROCUREMENT 
PROCEDURE (OCPP) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

588 
 
CHAPTER X 
OTHER CAPITAL PROCUREMENT PROCEDURE (OCPP) 
 
 
Background 
 
1. 
Acquisition of new capital assets for the Services is to be undertaken as per the procedure 
defined in the preceding Chapters. Apart from such capital assets, there are other items of capital 
nature that enhance the utility of existing assets. Expenditure on such items is also treated as 
Capital expenditure, which is based on Rule 84 of General Financial Rules (GFR) 2017 which 
defines capital expenditure as ‘Significant expenditure incurred with the object of acquiring 
tangible assets of a permanent nature (for use in the organization and not for sale in the ordinary 
course of business) or enhancing the utility of existing assets’. In the context of defence 
procurements, such items of capital nature that enhance the utility of existing assets include 
overhauls, major refits and upgrades of existing platforms/equipment. Such items will be covered 
in the procedure prescribed in this Chapter.  
  
 Scope 
 
2. 
Items such as overhauls, refits, upgrades and replacement of items of Capital nature etc. 
which enhance the utility of existing assets in terms of the definition laid out in GFRs 2017, will 
henceforth be procured under the procedure laid out in the succeeding paras of this Chapter. This 
Procedure will be referred to as ‘Other Capital Procurement Procedure’ (OCPP). The 
procurement under this chapter will be as per list of items (as amended from time to time), which 
will be drawn up by HQ IDS and respective SHQs and promulgated by DG (Acquisition) in 
consultation with MoD (Finance). 
 
3. 
Thus, OCPP will be applicable only to procurements involving expenditure on overhaul, 
refits, upgrades and replacement of items of Capital nature while expenditure on items of routine 
maintenance, repair etc., will be incurred under Revenue Budget following the DPM. It will be 
ensured that items covered under this Chapter will not be taken up for procurement under 
procedure defined in other Chapters of DAP. 
  
Parameters for Procurements under OCPP 
 
4. 
Repeat Procurements. 
Wherever feasible, for repeat procurements, quantities 
should be projected on the basis of consumption pattern based on data for the maximum period 
available.  
 

589 
 
5. 
CFA.   CFA for OCPP cases will be as per Capital Acquisition process. However, in 
view of the peculiarity of procurement under this Chapter and the number of items required to be 
procured frequently, certain delegation of powers have been undertaken for ease of processing 
and timely procurement. These are as under:- 
 
(a) 
Upto ₹ 100 Crores.   GOC-in-C, FOC-in-C, AOC-in-C at Command HQ and

CHAPTER XI 
 
 POST CONTRACT MANAGEMENT 
(PCM) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

593 
 
CHAPTER XI 
POST CONTRACT MANAGEMENT(PCM) 
 
Introduction 
 
1. 
 A Contract is a legal document; therefore, it needs to be ensured that both parties 
strictly abide by the terms and conditions of the contract. Post contract, management is a very 
important activity and ensures compliance with the terms and conditions of contract, 
managing contractual amendments, quality assurance, timely payment and deliveries and 
resolving claims and disputes. In cases of Letter of Acceptance (LOA) with the US 
Government and other IGA are also to be treated at par with Contracts for the purpose of 
execution of Contracts.  
 
2. 
The responsibility for contract administration (preparation and distribution of contract 
document as per terms of RFP) and management (ensuring timely payments and deliveries, 
management of guarantees, quality assurance, extensions and contract amendments, Contract 
closure/termination, arbitration and any other issue) would be that of the SHQ concerned. 
Post-contract monitoring, however, would be done by MoD (Acquisition) and SHQ will 
submit a quarterly report to DG(Acquisition) of cases with contract management issues. 
 
First Off Production Model (FoPM) 
 
3. 
Capital procurement cases involving validation at First Off Production Model (FoPM) 
would be as per RFP/Contract. Post successful FoPM validation by the Buyer, accord of BPC 
would be given for production and deliveries. The timeline for FoPM will be as per the 
RFP/Contract. Delay in FoPM validation may be permitted upto a maximum of 25% of the 
total period after due approval of VCOAS/VCNS/DCAS/CISC/DGICG and maximum upto 
50% with approval of DG(Acquisition). However, for the delay in FoPM, if vendor is found 
responsible, the duration of delay for accord of BPC post FoPM would be deducted from the 
time schedule of first lot of deliveries as per the contract. 
 
Inspection –Pre Dispatch Inspection (PDI)/ Joint Receipt Inspection (JRI) 
 
4. 
The Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP) is finalised in the contract and would be 
executed accordingly. The cost of PDI and JRI will be borne by the seller and buyer as per 
contractual provisions respectively. In case the buyer is not satisfied with the quality during 
PDI, the same would be repeated at the cost of seller. 
 
5. 
The composition of the PDI committee for equipment procured from abroad is specified 
in the contract, the approval of the names to be accorded by the VCOAS/VCNS/VCAS/ 
DCAS/CISC/DGICG and further processed to MoD for obtaining GSL. For PDI the Seller 
should inform the Buyer at least 45 days in advance prior to the Inspection day or as per 
schedule as agreed to. For PDI in India, the Seller should inform the Buyer concerned and QA 
agency at least two weeks prior to the Inspection day or as per schedule as agreed to. In case the 
PDI team is not able to reach as per schedule as agreed to, revised schedule may be coordinated 

594 
 
within the same framework as of original PDI. In cases where the buyer is unable to attend, 
payment will be released on the PDI being carried out by the Seller in his premises and 
submitting the documents to the buyer. If the delay by seller in intimation leads to delay in 
delivery, appropriate LD will be imposed. In case delay is attributable to the buyer which may 
lead to delay in delivery, PDI certificate be accepted from the seller and essential tests be done 
at JRI, if required. The seller will also provide the inspector all the necessary facilities including 
appliances, tools, material and labour at no extra cost, to carry out the specified inspection.  
When independent tests and analysis, in addition to those made by the inspector on the seller’s 
or sub-seller’s premises, are considered necessary as per contract, the seller shall provide testing 
at Seller’s expense and deliver, free of charge, at such place as the Buyer may direct, such 
materials as he may require for tests or analysis. The PDI team/agency will update the Contract 
Executing Officer at regular intervals regarding the progress of PDI of equipment/ESP and 
vetting of technical literature. Vetting of technical literature by the QA/ nominated agency will 
be completed within four weeks of submission by the vendor so that the vendor can submit the 
same within the timelines as stipulated in the Contract. Any delay in PDI, including vetting of 
technical literature, will be immediately intimated to the Contract Executing Officer. 
 
6. 
It shall be ensured that aspects inspected during PDI are not re-inspected during JRI. 
Unless necessitated, discrepancy or defects found during JRI shall be reported to the seller as 
per timelines in Contract. The seller on receiving intimation shall rectify the same within 
period specified in contract. In case the supplied item fails during JRI due to any reason, it 
will be the responsibility of the seller to replace the same within the delivery period at his 
cost and expense. 
 
7. 
Buyer can order re-JRI if the consignment received are not as per specification in 
quality. The Re-JRI will be at the cost of seller. 
 
8. 
Packaging and Dispatch. 
The stores are required to be packaged as per terms and 
conditions of the contract. In case the stores are not packed as specified in the contract then 
PWBG should be retained till it is certified by QA agency that deviation has not resulted in 
any adverse effect of consignment. 
 
Change of Name of Vendor 
 
9. 
Whenever a change in vendor name occurs during any stage of procurement process 
whether Pre-contract or Post-contract due to any reason, relevant guidelines/procedure as 
given at Appendix K to Chapter II, are to be followed. 
 
10. 
The approval for name change shall be communicated to the Vendor within three 
months of submission of complete documentation by vendor.  
 
11. 
If the firm is involved in multiple contracts/ procurement cases, a single case will be 
progressed for seeking approval of the appropriate competent authority. All relevant 
documents with respect to multiple contracts/ procurement cases as per guidelines at 
Appendix F of Chapter II will be obtained from the vendor. If change of name is approved in 

595 
 
a contract/ procurement case, the same will deemed to be approved for all other cases at any 
stage. The Acquisition Wing will inform all concerned organisations of MoD regarding the 
change of name of vendor. 
 
Bank Guarantees (BGs) Management 
 
12. 
The vendor is required to furnish Bank Guarantees as specified in the RFP and 
Contract.   In the case of separate Offset Contract applicable for ‘Buy and Make’ and Buy 
(Global) categories which has been signed between Buyer and Seller, the Bank Guarantees 
with respect to the Offset Contract are to be issued and maintained by DOMW. All Offset 
contract correspondence also to be dealt with DOMW. 
 
13. 
The Bank Guarantee for IPBG, Advance payment, PWBG, and Additional Bank 
Guarantee for Essential parameters - B are kept in a sealed envelope under lock and key with 
the Contract Executing Authority i.e. concerned directorate in the SHQ. The bidder may 
furnish BG from any Indian Public or Private Scheduled Commercial Bank notified by RBI 
or first-class banks of international repute. 
 
14.

A formal request for extension of BG is sent to the Bank a month prior to expiry date. 
In case of extension of Bank Guarantee, re-validated BG is re-verified with other branch of 
the same bank and thereafter sealed and kept under lock and key. 
 
16. 
Para 8.2 of Annexure I to Appendix O of Schedule I to Chapter II on Pre-Contract 
Integrity inter alia states that the IPBG shall be valid up to three years from the date of 
submission, the same would be kept in Custody of AMs/ SHQ till finalization of Contract. 
Post conclusion of Contract the same would be sent to SHQ who will return the IPBG to 
vendor post successful completion of Contract within four to six weeks. However, Bidders 
will be required to extend the IPBG as and when required by the buyer. In the case of the 
successful bidder, validity of the IPBG will be extended upto the satisfactory completion of 
the contract. On declaration of L1 vendor, the other vendors are at liberty to withdraw their 
IPBGs. However, the attention of vendors may be drawn to Para 106-107 of 
Chapter II regarding negotiation with L2 vendors. The IPBGs of such vendors will be 
returned within four to six weeks of application for withdrawal of IPBG.  
 
17. 
Post signing of contract, it shall be the responsibility of the Contract Executing

29. 
The milestones as defined in the contract to be monitored by the SHQ and report to be 
submitted to Acquisition Wing on achieving the milestones. Any issues if encountered during 
the contract to be brought to the notice of Acquisition Wing. 
 
30. 
Failure to Deliver within the Delivery Period (DP). When the supplies do not 
materialise by the stipulated contract delivery date, either of the under mentioned action 
should be initiated: - 
 
(a) 
Issuing a performance notice. 
 
(b) 
Extending the delivery date with imposition of LD and Denial Clause, which 
implies denial of increase in price, taxes, duties, etc. taking place during the extended 
period as also requisite extension of warranties/BGs in case of delay/DP extension. 
  
(c) 
Cancelling the contract. 
 
(d) 
Initiation of punitive action as per the terms and conditions of the contract.  
 
31. 
Deciding the Course of Action in the Event of Failure of Supply. Extension shall 
be granted only where the DG(Acquisition)/ Vice Chiefs /DGICG are convinced that seller 
would come forward during extended DP. All DP extensions with or without LD as well as 
provisional DP would be granted as per extant delegation of powers as applicable on a case to 
case basis. Provisional/ changed Delivery Period will be accorded on a case to case basis.  
 
32. 
Cases involving extension of DP with or without imposition of LD shall be brought to 
the notice of DG(Acquisition)/ Defence Secretary and RM when the extension involves 
delays of six months and 12 months respectively, so that project time overruns are 
highlighted, in accordance with extant delegation of powers for Post Contract management, 
as amended from time to time. 
 
Liquidated Damages and Other Post-Contractual Issues

amendments are necessitated particularly with regard to cases necessitating extension of 
delivery period, imposition or waiver of LD and release of milestone linked payments, 
guidelines as given in subsequent paragraphs shall be followed. These guidelines are intended 
to ensure uniformity in dealing with cases of DP extension and also to address delays in 
processing of DP extension cases so that project deliverables are not further impeded. The 
quantum of LD to be imposed shall be within the ceiling provided in the Contract. This 

601 
 
should also include levying LD in case of delay in mutually agreed timelines which are 
specified for warranty repairs at the time of signing of contract. The Liquidated Damages will 
be based on Base Contract prices of delayed goods as given in the RFP/Contract. Other 
provisions in Contract which may provide for parties to resort to other measures to resolve 
delays on non-compliance in contract implementation shall have no effect on the LD ceiling 
as provided in the Contract. The details are as given at Appendix A. 
 
Contract Amendment Procedure 
 
34. 
Contract Amendment Procedure is as given at Appendix B to this Chapter. 
 
Delegation of Powers for Post Contract Management 
 
35. 
The powers for Post-Contract Management of Capital Acquisition contracts is 
delegated in accordance with extant delegations of powers irrespective of the CFA at the time 
of sanctioning the contract and are listed at Appendix C to this Chapter. 
 
Alteration/ Obsolescence Management/ Upgradation of the Equipment Post Signing of 
Contract 
 
36. 
After signing of the contract, there may be a need to carry out technical 
alterations/upgradation in the design, drawings and specifications of the equipment due to 
change in manufacturing procedures, Indigenisation or obsolescence, with the vendor giving 
certificate that alterations/upgradations would be at no additional cost and no reduction in 
prices. However, in cases where it involves increase in cost, a Professional Officers’ 
Valuation (POV) may be setup to establish the optimal cost variation for contract 
amendment.  
 
37. 
SHQ, in consultation with other stakeholders, will analyse the upgrades/ alterations 
offered by the Seller and the approximate time required for carrying out the Limited 
Validation Trial of the upgrades/ alterations. An undertaking may be sought from the vendor 
at this stage that LD would be imposed on him if any delay occurs due to failing of proposed 
modification in equipment during limited validation trials or due to non-cooperation by the 
vendor in sharing data. For upgrades/alterations Contract Amendment needs to be undertaken 
as per extant delegation of powers for Post Contract Management of Capital Acquisition 
Contracts. However, if the upgrade/alteration involves a change in SQR, approval of the 
AON according authority will be obtained. 
  
38. 
If the time required is more than six months, the present contract need not be accepted 
on grounds of likely delay in the current procurement. The cumulative time for this purpose 
should include time for preparation of equipment after upgradation, fielding upgraded 
equipment for trials, completion of validation trials alongwith evaluation, upgradation/ 
alteration offered by the Seller on account of change in manufacturing procedures, 
indigenisation or obsolescence. However, especially in cases of obsolescence management 
which may require more than six months, the time period may be extended on a case to case 

602 
 
basis by the competent authority. If such changes are technically approved by the SHQ, it 
shall move a case for Contract Amendment to incorporate such changes, to the Contract 
Signing Authority. 
 
Verification of Indigenous Content 
 
39. 
The format for computation of IC, ‘Indigenous Content (IC) Proforma’ by the Prime 
Vendor is placed as Annexure I to Appendix B of Chapter I. The Prime Contractor is required 
to maintain this Proforma for the purpose of any verification by the Contracting Authority 
during the tenure of the contract.   
 
40. 
Verification of the IC aspects in a contract, if required will be conducted by a 
Committee headed by Advisor/Director (Cost) and may include members from the SHQ and 
MoD (Finance). Other technical/financial experts from any Government organisations may 
be co-opted into the Committee, as and when required. 
 
41. 
A Committee may be constituted by the DG (Acquisition) at any time during the 
execution of the contract, including the warranty period, and shall submit its report within 
three months. 
 
42. 
The Committee may visit vendor premises and/or call for relevant information from 
the vendor to verify the IC certification, submitted by the vendor on a case to case basis. The 
vendor shall facilitate the visit of the Committee to vendor premises and/or provide the 
Committee with all relevant documents and information required for verification of IC. It 
shall be incumbent upon the vendor to gather all relevant documents and certifications in 
respect of IC aspects of the equipment from his Tier 1 and Tier 2 vendors and provide the 
same to the committee. 
 
43. 
The report shall be examined by MoD (Acquisition) and compliances/non 
compliances/shortcomings in the IC aspects will be suitably communicated to the vendor. 
 
44. 
In case of any shortcomings noticed in the compliance to IC aspects, procedure as 
detailed in Para 13 and 14 of Appendix B of Chapter I, shall be initiated. 
 
45. 
The JS & AM may ask the vendor to submit relevant documents in support of action 
taken to remove the above-mentioned shortcomings or order another verification. 
 
Buy Back of Spares 
 
46. 
During the process of procurement, the Buy Back Clause will form part of RFP. The 
buyer reserves the right to change/ alter MRLS as proposed by seller in range and depth 
within a period specified in the contract, post expiry of the warranty period.  The same will 
form part of Buy Back Clause and included in the contract. In case the expenditure pattern is 
not as suggested by the seller, the buyer has the right to return the spares to seller at the cost 

603 
 
as per the contract. The Seller needs to agree to either ‘Buy Back’ the spares rendered surplus 
or exchange them on ‘cost-to-cost’ basis with the spares, as required by the Buyer.  
 
Claims 
 
47.  
The action regarding claims due to deficiency of quantity noticed during the JRI and 
quality for defect or deficiency noticed during the JRI or during warranty period shall as per 
Article 20 of the SCD. 
 
Arbitration 
 
48. 
 The provisions and process of arbitration are provided at Appendix O to Schedule I to 
Chapter II and Article 24 of Chapter VI.  
 
49. 
All disputes or differences arising out of or in connection with the Contract, including 
the one connected with the validity of the Contract or any part thereof, shall be settled by 
bilateral discussions. 
 
50. 
In case dispute or differences are not settled amicably despite best efforts of Seller and 
Buyer, the provisions and process contained in the concluded contract for arbitration shall be 
followed. 
 
51. 
The decision post arbitration will be moved on file for acceptance by Hon’ble RM for 
non-delegated case and VCOAS/VCNS/CISC/DCAS/DG(CG) for delegated power case. 
 
Termination of Contract 
 
52.  
SCD under Chapter VI of DPP 2020 provides Termination of Contract. Article 22 of 
SCD states that the contract can be terminated for default in delivery or meeting milestones 
by the seller or termination of Contract for (Procuring Entity’s) Convenience.  
 
53. 
 Procedure for Termination. 
SHQ shall submit the proposal with full 
justification for obtaining the approval of respective CFA for termination of contract. 
Termination of CCS/Finance Minister approved cases will be put up for approval of RM.

Appendix A 
(Refers to Paragraph 38 of 
Chapter XI) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND OTHER POST-CONTRACTUAL ISSUES 
 
1. 
The following procedure will be followed: - 
 
(a) 
In all cases where a delay in delivery of project/ project milestones should 
move a case for DP extension at least three months prior to contract delivery date with 
an assessment of liability towards LD. 
 
(b) 
Unless and until termination of contract is being contemplated: - 
 
(i) 
DP extension may be granted with LD in usual course through a 
contract amendment wherever liability for the same is clear and not disputed 
by the vendor. 
 
(ii) 
DP extension may be granted provisionally where attributability for 
delay is in dispute with the stipulation that payment in lieu of LD will be 
withheld pending determination of attributability. Provisional DP extension 
should be given for the purpose of release of milestone payments, undertaking 
PDI and accepting deliveries subject to final assessment of the attributability 
of delay. 
 
(iii) 
In cases where attributability is disputed, this aspect will be examined 
by the concerned JS & AM and FM for MoD level cases and SHQ/IFA 
(Capital) for Delegated Cases, wherever felt necessary, a collegiate can be 
appointed by the concerned AMs/SHQ. Based on the recommendations of the 
concerned JS & AM and FM/Collegiate as the case may be, proposal for 
formal contract amendment would be moved for approval of competent 
authority. LD in such contracts shall normally be deducted from the final 
installment due to the contractor and it should be ensured that the amount is 
sufficient to cover the maximum LD as provided for. 
 
(iv) 
Where deemed necessary, the recovery of LD as in (b)(i) and 
withholding of payment in lieu of LD as in (b)(ii) above may be done in a 
phased and proportionate manner from milestone payments after ensuring that 
sufficient balances would remain available for ensuring full recovery of LD by 
the time final payments are released. If the amount of the final installment is 
not sufficient to cover the amount of LD, the same may be deducted from the 
installment/ installment preceding the final installment until the entire amount 
of LD is covered. The amount withheld/recovered from each milestone 
payment should ordinarily not exceed 10% of the due milestone payment and 
overall amount withheld till the last payment should be limited to maximum 

605 
 
permissible LD. Amounts withheld from stage payment due to vendor will be 
adjusted in final installment after deciding on imposition of LD. 
 
2. 
Contracts with Deliveries in Lots/Consignments.  
For 
this 
category 
of 
contract, the following procedure will be followed: - 
 
(a) 
DP extension may be granted with LD by way of contract amendment 
wherever liability for the same is clear and not disputed by the vendor in the usual 
course. 
 
 
(b) 
DP extension may be granted provisionally where attributability for delay is in 
dispute with the stipulation that payment in lieu of LD will be withheld pending 
determination of attributability. Provisional DP extension should be given for the 
purpose of undertaking PDI, accepting deliveries and release of payment subject to 
final assessment of the attributability of delay. 
 
 
(c) 
In cases of staggered delivery, DP extension may be granted provisionally as 
above and payments may be released accordingly after receipt of each 
lot/consignment. However, it must be ensured, as far as possible, that before giving 
provisional DP extension for the next lot/consignment, contract amendment has 
already been done for the previous provisional DP extension of the preceding 
lot/consignment with LD liability, wherever required. 
 
 
(d) 
In cases where attributability is disputed, this aspect will be examined by the 
concerned JS & AM and FM for MoD level cases and, wherever felt necessary, a 
collegiate can be appointed by the concerned AM. Based on the recommendations of 
the concerned JS & AM and FM/Collegiate, as the case may be, proposal for formal 
contract amendment would be moved for approval of competent authority. 
 
 
(e) 
While effecting DP extension with or without LD for a specific 
lot/consignment, the Competent Authority shall also assess the cascading effect, if 
any, of the DP extension on subsequent lots/consignments and clarify the same in the 
instant Contract Amendment/DP extension. 
 
3. 
General Aspects. 
 
 
(a) 
Proposal for DP extension often are combined with other types of amendments 
in a single case. This leads to delay in processing amendments related to DP 
extensions. Hence, unless it is unavoidable, proposals for contract amendments for DP 
extensions should not be combined with other amendments. 
 
(b) 
In delegated power cases, SHQ shall adopt the above in consultation with 
IFAs. 
 

606 
 
4. 
The cases of DP extension with or without LD involving project time over run beyond 
25% and 50% of the delivery schedule shall be brought to the notice of DG(Acq) and 
Defence Secretary respectively. 
 
5. 
For cases involving Alteration/ Upgradation of the Equipment Post Signing of 
Contract the flow chart is given as Annexure I.

CONTRACT AMENDMENT PROCEDURE 
 
1. 
Article 32 of Standard Contract Document (SCD) on `Amendments' mentions `No 
provisions of the Contract shall be changed or modified in any way (including these 
provisions) either in whole or in part except with an instrument in writing made after the date 
of this contract and signed on behalf of both Parties & which expressly states to amend the 
Contract'.  
 
2. 
No variation in the terms of a concluded contract should normally be made, unless the 
contract specifically provides for it, in which case this can be done with the specific written 
consent of the parties to the contract and after due approval of the competent approving 
authority.  
 
3. 
Amendment to a contract already concluded may become essential in certain 
situations and the case shall be processed for obtaining approval as per applicable delegation 
of powers to concurring and approving authorities for such amendments.  
 
4. 
Amendment to Contract in Multi Service Cases.   In case of multiservice contracts, 
contract amendment will be initiated by the affected SHQ. The affected SHQ will circulate 
the draft Contract Amendment to the other services which have also sought procurement 
under same combined contract. These Services will clearly indicate their desire to effect the 
same amendment in the Contract. Post receipt of comments, proposal for contract amendment 
would then be processed by the Lead SHQ, through the original contract concluding JS & 
AM/SHQ, for approval of the Approving Authority for non delegated and delegated cases as 
per Appendix Cto this chapter (as amended from time to time). All other post contract issues 
pertaining to its management and monitoring will be processed by SHQ through their 
respective JS &AM/ Procurement Directorate of the SHQ. 
 
5. 
No enhancement in rates/prices should be made unless the contract specifically 
provides for it. Such situations may arise in those cases where the contract provides for price 
variation clauses or the change is due to variation in GST/Custom Duties/other Government 
taxes & levies and the contract provides for payment of these duties on the basis of actual 
rates, provided the supplies are made during the original delivery period (with denial clause 
wherever applicable). 
 
6. 
Once the Contract Amendment is signed by both the parties, it should be ensured by 
Service Headquarters that the copies are distributed to the concerned parties. After the 
distribution of Contract Amendment copies, the original contract or a copy should be placed 
in a folder and all important milestones should be chalked out for monitoring the payments 
and supplies till all the supplies and obligation are completed.  

609 
 
7. 
The need for Contract Amendment is required to be envisaged by seller and buyer 
well before the milestone/event impacted by the contract amendment and contract 
amendment shall usually be signed before the milestone/event impacted.  
 
8. 
All contract amendments process to be completed within three months of initiation. 
 
9. 
A status report on contract amendments in pipeline shall be presented by Service 
Headquarter to DG (Acq) on quarterly basis.

deliveries locally after the expiry of DP, the supplies may be provisionally retained under a 
franking clause reserving rights and the Contractor (i.e the Vendor) may be asked to obtain an 
extension of the delivery period from the authorised officer(i.e Contract Executing Authority) 
with or without any LD/denial clause. The following undertaking to be taken from the 
vendor:- 
“The  materials have been supplied after the expiry of contracted delivery date and its 
provisional retention does not acquiesce or condone the late delivery and does not intend or 
amount to an extension of the delivery period or keeping the contract alive. I shall be

CHAPTER XII 
 
PROCEDURE FOR DEFENCE SHIP 
BUILDING 

612 
 
CHAPTER XII 
 
PROCEDURE FOR DEFENCE SHIP BUILDING 
 
General 
 
1. 
A Naval/Coast Guard ship consists of an assortment of equipment comprising 
weapons, sensors and support systems, along with propulsion, power generation and auxiliary 
systems. In addition, the warship design caters for the facilities for crew, fuel and provisions. 
The system integration of complex weapons and sensors with the ship’s systems and combat 
management system is crucial for a ship design and construction project.  
 
2. 
To achieve this successfully, a ship construction program, therefore, involves 
feasibility studies on the basis of the staff requirements, concept design, model tests, 
specialists design studies to arrive at detailed design, system integration, construction, tests 
and trials. It also involves technology application and its transfer, selection of equipment 
including new developmental equipment, identification and purchase of large number of 
items from numerous indigenous and foreign suppliers. 
 
Preamble 
 
3. 
Naval shipbuilding is a capital and technology intensive complex activity that requires 
a separate procedure for design/construction/acquisition of naval ships, submarines, yard 
crafts, auxiliary ships and Coast Guard vessels through design/construction. This Chapter is 
divided into three sections as follows: - 
 
(a) 
Section ‘A’. Acquisition of highly weapon intensive and/or specialised Naval 
platforms requiring transformational and evolutionary design like Aircraft Carrier, 
Next Generation Destroyer, through indigenous design by SHQ and construction by 
Indian  shipyard(s) on nomination basis.  
 
(b) 
Section ‘B’. Acquisition of Naval Ships/Submarines, Coast Guard ships, Yard 
crafts and Auxiliary Crafts etc. to be constructed on competitive basis. 
 
(c) 
Section ‘C’. Acquisition of Naval Ships/Submarines of indigenous design by 
SHQ to be constructed by Indian Shipyards on competitive basis.  
 
4. 
The fundamental difference between Shipbuilding procedures under nomination 
(Section A) and Competitive (Section B & C) is that, the cases where it is not feasible to 
freeze the design inputs due to evolutionary design and the complexity of the platform 
requires demonstrated capability of building similar ships of high complexity, or construction 
of the platform requires exclusive infrastructure that only one shipyard has, will be 
progressed under Section A. Cases where it is feasible to freeze the requirements in such 
details, prior to issue of RFP, would be progressed under Section B or C.  

613 
 
5. 
Contract Operating Authority. The Contract Operating Authority (COA/ DDG 
(M&M)) refers to the ability given to act on behalf of the President of India in order to 
execute all activities towards completion of the shipbuilding contract. The nominated COA/ 
DDG (M&M), in the major shipbuilding projects (approved by CCS) should be of the rank 
equivalent to Rear Admiral or above. For schemes which are processed under powers of SHQ 
or RM/ FM the COA can be of the rank equivalent to Commodore.  
 
6. 
Actions indicated for Naval authorities in succeeding paragraphs would be carried out 
by Coast Guard authorities mutatis-mutandis, in cases where this procedure is followed for 
Coast Guard acquisitions. 
 

614 
 
SECTION ‘A’ 
 
ACQUISITION OF NAVAL SHIPS AND SUBMARINES 
BY NOMINATION TO INDIAN SHIPYARD(S) 
 
7. 
Applicability. This section is applicable for acquisition of highly weapon intensive 
and/or specialized Naval platforms requiring transformational and evolutionary design like 
Aircraft Carrier, Next Generation Destroyer etc. through indigenous design by SHQ and 
construction by Indian Shipyard(s) on nomination basis. Ship building projects, wherein it is 
not feasible to freeze the design inputs due to evolutionary design and complexity of platform 
requires demonstrated capability of building similar ships, or wherein construction of the 
platform requires exclusive infrastructure which is available with only one shipyard, shall be 
progressed in accordance with the provision of this section. 
 
8. 
Procedure.  Naval Ship Building Procedure under this section will cover the 
following: - 
 
(a) 
 Outline Staff Requirements (OSRs). 
 
(b) 
Feasibility Studies and Concept Design. 
 
(c) 
 Acceptance of Necessity & Nomination of Shipyards. 
 
(d)

615 
 
 
(p) 
Closure of the Project. 
 
(q) 
Liquidated Damages, if applicable. 
 
9. 
Outline Staff Requirements. SHQ shall prepare the Outline Staff Requirements 
(OSRs), which shall include the role of the ship, dimensions of its hull, limiting dimensions 
and endurance if any, capability of major machinery, weapons, sensors and details of 
accommodation, manpower, endurance etc. 
 
10. 
Feasibility Studies and Concept Design. The OSRs would form the basis on which 
the feasibility studies and concept design of the ship would be undertaken by SHQ along with 
identification of OEMs/vendors for specific weapons, sensors, machinery and equipment. 
 
11. 
Acceptance of Necessity (AoN). The proposal for induction of the ships shall be 
linked to the Maritime Capability Perspective Plan (MCPP)/Five Years Plan which stipulates 
the numbers and type of vessels required. The Statement of Case for the proposal shall be 
prepared by SHQ and processed in line with the details given in Chapter II of DAP. This will 
inter alia contain Outline Staff Requirements, broad category of weapons and sensors to be 
fitted on the ship along with the status of their indigenous development if applicable, 
operational necessity, approximate cost and budgetary provisions. The proposal shall clearly 
indicate whether it is a new design, Follow-on ships or Follow-on ships with 
design/equipment changes. The validity of the AON will be 36 months. The budgetary and 
estimated cost by shipyard would have to be submitted within the AoN validity period. 
 
12. 
Design Studies. In certain cases, the Functional design studies for construction of 
major platforms could involve Model testing, Computational Analysis, other consultancies/ 
design validation studies and procurement of design tools/ software/ hardware. Separate case 
may be taken up to progress Preliminary/Functional design work such as design validation 
studies,  consultancy services, development of Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) and 
creation of design facilities including procurement of software/hardware which will be 
projected to the AoN according authority, based on proposal in SoC. 
  
13. 
Nomination of Shipyard.  For nomination of the Shipyard(s) under this category, 
SHQ would undertake Technical Capacity Assessment of the entities against parameters 
listed at Annexure I to Appendix C. Names of the entities qualifying all Technical Capacity 
Assessment Parameters shall be forwarded to MoD prior to processing the case for accord of 
AoN. If more than one entity is nominated, lead entity shall be indicated along with 
allocation of ships to each Shipyard. 
 
14. 
Cases for nomination of Yard for Coast Guard ships will be approved by AoN 
according authority. 
 

616 
 
15. 
Staff Requirements (SRs). On completion of the feasibility studies, the OSRs may 
be refined, without any change in the operational parameters i.e. role of the ship, on which 
the AoN was accorded and Staff Requirements (SRs) are to be promulgated within three 
months of grant of AoN. The procedures for formulation of Services Qualitative 
Requirements (SQR) for procurement of equipment would be as per the procedures at 
Chapter II of DAP. 
 
16. 
Preliminary Design. Based on the promulgated SRs, the preliminary design, 
including hull form design, weapons/sensors/equipment fit, identification of OEMs/vendors 
for specific equipment, model tests, validation studies and other design activities shall be 
carried out by SHQ / Shipyard in consultation, as necessary. This activity shall complete 
within 18 months of promulgation of SRs. During this period, the propulsion package, 
weapons/sensors, hull equipment and engine equipment may be identified by the SHQ. 
 
17. 
Developmental Equipment.  Due to long gestation period in Ship-building, there 
may be occasions when systems/equipment, which are still under development or not fully 
evaluated, are considered to ensure that the ship, when ready, has the latest state-of-the-art 
capabilities at the time of induction into service. The dates for freezing of such 
developmental system would be indicated in the Outline specifications/RFP (as applicable) 
and subsequently included in the contracts. Since adaptation of developmental systems or 
shortfalls in installation/trials of the equipment may also result in modifications in the design 
of the ship; as a safeguard, the RFP/Outline specifications and contracts may indicate Fall-
back option (i.e. alternate equipment) that would be installed when the envisaged timelines 
for development of system/equipment are exceeded or if the FET/ UET has not been 
successful. Weapon and related sensors, under Fall-back option, would have to be included in 
the SoC during AoN stage along with the cut-off date. 
 
Preliminary Build Specifications 
 
18. 
Based on the preliminary design, the Preliminary Build Specifications (PBS) of the 
vessel shall be prepared by SHQ and forwarded to the nominated shipyard(s). This activity 
must complete within 21 months of promulgation of SRs. 
 
19. 
In cases where the vessel is not designed by SHQ, the nominated shipyard will 
prepare the preliminary build specifications based on the SRs and finalise these, along with 
functional design (if applicable), draft contract and other related documents in consultation 
with SHQ. 
 
20. 
Build Strategy. Based on the PBS, the nominated shipyard shall propose a build 
strategy indicating delivery schedules, yard infrastructure and available resources. Build 
strategy must be forwarded within 06 months of receipt of Preliminary Build Specifications 
from SHQ. Build Strategy would include the proposed construction schedule, Level-1 work 
breakdown structure, detailed master control plan along with resource allocation plan for 
utilisation of shipyard manpower, infrastructure and committed infrastructure up-gradation 

617 
 
specific to the project, if applicable, outsourcing plan, tentative procurement schedule for 
long lead items including weapons and sensors and the schedule for design documentation 
and drawings. This should also include shipyard’s plans to meet the resource requirements of 
new project together with other on-going projects. Shipyard in their build strategy should 
provide ‘Gap Analysis’ for various resources so that a more practical outsourcing plan can be 
envisaged at this stage. This would also help IN/ICG in assessing ‘Actual’ strategy of 
shipyard. Build Strategy would be approved by SHQ within three months of its receipt. 
 
21. 
Budgetary Cost. Within three months of approval of the Build Strategy by SHQ, the 
shipyard shall forward a budgetary cost for construction of the ship along with the draft 
contract. 
 
New Design Ships/Follow-On Ships with major Design/ Equipment Changes 
 
22. 
Budgetary Cost. In case of new design projects or Follow-on projects with major 
design/equipment changes, the shipyard will forward estimated budgetary cost broken down 
to the extent possible, into standard elements such as labour cost indicating number of man-
days, overheads, direct expenses, profits payable to shipyard, specially contracted works, cost 
of raw material, cost of major equipment, weapons, sensors and propulsion machinery, 
freight, insurance, clearing charges, taxes, duties and levies on input materials and services, 
etc as well as the expected year wise cash flow. The cost should take into account normal 
escalation at the scheduled time of procurement, to arrive at an estimated completion cost. 
Details of cost elements, which cannot be assessed at this stage such as cost of 
new/developmental equipment, exchange rate variation, etc should be explicitly indicated. 
 
23. 
Estimated Cost. The estimated cost of the project shall include the budgetary cost 
provided by the shipyard along with costs towards project studies, functional design 
development through design agencies and detailed design work by shipyard/specialist 
agencies. Augmentation of design facilities, creation of infrastructure and any other costs, in 
shipyard, if required are also to be reflected as separate items. Cost of supply of MRLS-B&D 
spares, up to 15% (excluding levies, taxes and handling charges, transportation, insurance, 
service tax on handling charges etc) of the basic cost of the vessel, cost of Services towards 
commissioning, setting to work (STW), testing and tuning spares and cost of on board spares 
(MRL-OBS) for onboard scheduled servicing and maintenance of all equipment falling due 
up to two years of operation of the vessel after warranty period, may also be included in the 
Estimated Cost, as applicable. 
 
24. 
Variations in estimated cost of nominated equipment supplied by common single 
source, whether OFB, DPSU or private vendor will be paid as per final negotiated cost in the 
variable cost element of the project in accordance with Chapter II of the DAP 2020. For new 
design ships, the estimated cost shall be as close to final cost as possible, explicitly indicating 
variable cost elements and projected cost of weapons, sensors and other equipment under 
development, if any. Cost for BFE integration (on a case to case basis) will be decided by the 
CNC. 

618 
 
Follow-on Projects  
 
25. 
In case of ships of Follow-on projects with minor design changes, the shipyard shall 
forward budgetary cost as a firm cost for construction of the ship, with variable element only 
for new and developmental systems, if any, in conformance with the Build Strategy. 
 
26. 
The estimated cost for the follow-on ships with minor design changes is to be 
computed based on budgetary quote along with fixed and variable cost elements and cost 
broken down into labour cost indicating number of man-days, overheads, direct expenses, 
profit payable to shipyard, specially contracted works, approximate cost of raw material and 
cost of major equipment, weapons, sensors and propulsion machinery. For the purpose of cost 
estimation of the complete project, cost of supply of MRLS-B&D spares, up to 15% 
(excluding levies, taxes and handling charges, transportation, insurance, service tax on 
handling charges etc) of the basic cost of the vessel and cost of on board spares for onboard 
scheduled servicing and maintenance of all equipment falling due till two years of operation 
of the vessel after warranty period, may also be included in the Estimated Cost, as applicable. 
 
27. 
Variations in estimated cost of nominated equipment to be supplied by a common 
single source, whether OFB, DPSU or private vendor in accordance with provision at Chapter 
II of the DAP 2020 will be paid as per the final negotiated cost of BNE, in the variable cost 
element of the project. 
 
28. 
Cost for BFE integration (on a case to case basis) will be decided by the CNC. 
 
Modification and Contingencies 
 
29. 
Modifications. The construction of ships may require to accommodate unforeseen 
changes necessitated due to minor operational requirements of the user etc. Since it is not 
feasible to forecast these, provision would be made for the same while obtaining CFA 
approval. Therefore, a percentage of basic cost of the vessels will be included on ‘Not 
Exceeding Basis’ for modifications (excluding the cost of BNE/Systems), subject to a 
maximum of 4%. Any extra time required beyond the delivery date of the ship, on account of 
modification would also be restricted to a maximum of 4% of the original contract delivery 
period under the project. Expenditure on each modification applicable to one / all ships of 
contract along with commensurate time extension (if any) will be approved by the concerned 
CFA based upon delegated financial powers in consultation with IFA. 
 
30. 
Contingencies. Contingencies for unforeseen expenditure of the project may also be 
catered, subject to a ceiling of 1% of basic cost of the vessel (excluding the cost of 
BNE/Systems). Contingencies may arise due to circumstances beyond the control of either of 
the parties. Payment towards contingencies will be made as per actuals. Expenditure on 
contingencies, along with commensurate time extension (if any), will be approved by the 
concerned CFA based upon delegated financial powers in consultation with IFA.  
Contingencies, inter alia, would cover broad categories such as following:- 

619 
 
 
(a) 
Extension of Warranty/ Guarantee of the equipment to cover delays not 
attributable to shipyard. 
 
(b) 
Operations and Maintenance of equipment and additional charges for services of 
Engineers in case of delays in ship’s delivery not attributable to shipyard. 
 
(c) 
To cover preservation cost of equipment with respect to delay in ship’s delivery 
not attributable to shipyard.  
 
31. 
Contract Negotiations. Before seeking the approval of CFA, negotiations on the 
price and terms and conditions for delivery of the ships are to be undertaken with the 
shipyard and concluded by Contract Negotiation Committee (CNC). The standard 
composition of the CNC shall be as per Chapter II. 
 
Approval of CFA 
 
32. 
The proposal for the design and construction of the ship is to be taken up for the 
approval of the CFA on completion of CNC. 
 
33. 
The proposal for CFA approval should indicate the estimated cost of the project as 
brought out above, the time schedule for completion, spread of expenditure, availability of 
funds, categories and details of major weapons, sensors, propulsion machinery and other 
major equipment sought for fitment on the ship. The capability and potency of the weapons 
and related sensors may be clearly indicated in the draft CCS note. 
 
34. 
While seeking CFA approval, the time schedule for the following activities, as 
applicable, may also be specifically indicated, if not already completed: - 
 
(a) 
Freezing of SRs. 
 
(b) 
Selection of weapons and sensors including those under development. 
 
(c) 
Time required for project studies, design, model testing etc in case of projects 
involving concurrent development/design. 
 
(d) 
Freezing of preliminary design. 
 
(e) 
Broad ordering schedule for weapons and sensors, major equipment and 
propulsion machinery and also price negotiations with nominated shipyard for the 
entire project in case of Follow-on Projects. The schedule should also bring out BFE 
ordering, availability of binding data and delivery of the equipment. 
 

620 
 
(f) 
Time schedule for obtaining subsequent approval of CFA for new design ships, 
Follow on ships with substantial design/equipment changes. 
 
35. 
For ‘Follow on Ships’, CFA approval would be sought on fixed price basis if there are 
minor changes in the design/equipment fit. In case of major changes in the design/equipment 
fit, CFA sanction is to be obtained in accordance with provisions of this section given 
subsequently. 
 
36. 
New Design Ships/Projects with Major Changes in Design/Equipment.  In cases 
of new design ships as well as Follow-on projects with major changes in design/equipment, 
where it is not possible to estimate the likely firm cost, subsequent approvals of CFA need to 
be obtained as the cost elements are firmed up. In such cases, based on the first stage 
approval of CFA, the work on shipbuilding, viz., ordering of equipment and material and 
development of detailed/production design etc, and commencement of construction can start. 
The ordering of equipment under variable component will be progressed in accordance with 
diagram at Paragraph 46. Thereafter, after firming up cost estimates under variable cost, 
second stage approval of CFA will be taken {on not exceeding basis (if necessary)}, within a 
period, as specified at time of initial CFA approval. 
 
Conclusion of Contract with the Shipyard 
 
37. 
The contracts should be on ‘Fixed Price’ basis for Follow-on ships and on Fixed plus 
Variable Price in case of new design or Follow-on ships with major design/equipment 
changes, indicating inter alia permissible price escalation, exchange rate variations, increase 
in statutory levies etc. The variable price element would be indicated, in Supplementary 
Contract based on 2nd stage CFA approval. 
 
38. 
The contract shall be signed within two months from date of CFA approval. In cases, 
where subsequent CCS approvals are necessitated, Supplementary Contracts shall be signed 
within two months of such approval. 
 
39.

guidelines for post contract management in accordance with MoD ID No. 1 (1)/D(Acq)/17 
dated 27 Feb 20 and amended from time to time. 
 
41. 
Detailed Design. On conclusion of contract, shipyard shall commence Detailed 
Design, order equipment & material and obtain binding data for the detailed design. The 
actual construction of the ship can, however, start in parallel along with the detailed design. 
 

621 
 
42. 
Preparatory Period. To achieve design maturity for the first ship of new design 
projects as well as follow on projects with changes in design/equipment vis-à-vis parent ship, 
preparatory period may be proposed in the respective SoC for AoN. The preparatory period 
will start from the date of first stage payment. The extent of detailed design completion to be 
targeted by end of preparatory period shall be finalized as part of shipbuilding contract.

47. 
Nomination of Equipment.   To enable standardisation, accruing advantage of ToT, 
retain/select equipment on Follow-on ships which are fundamental to design, facilitate 
interchangeability, interoperability, optimization of repair infrastructure, maintenance and 
support of OEM, spares logistics and inventory control etc SHQ may nominate these in-
service equipment and weapon sensors from single vendor. For Weapons and Sensors 
nominated on Single Vendor by SHQ, procedures of obtaining approval of AoN for 
shipbuilding scheme will be followed. For other equipment, not being weapon and related 
sensors, the requirement of single vendor nomination will be vetted by a Committee 
comprising members from SHQ, DDP (Directorate of Standardisation) and Shipyard 
representative. Based on the recommendations of the Committee, a certificate for 
procurement on single vendor basis, duly approved by PSO, will be issued. For the 
procurement of BNE equipment, the extant policy of MoD would be applicable. 
 
48. 
The Statement of Technical Requirements (SOTRs) and Ordering Instructions (OIs) 
for the shipyard will be prepared by SHQ as per approved procedure within SHQ. 
 
49. 
Single Vendor Situations.  In cases where certain state-of-the-art new weapons and 
related sensors being manufactured by only one vendor are to be utilised, and being procured 
for the first time (BFE), the procedure set out in Chapter II shall be followed. 
 
50. 
Inter Government Agreement/ Strategic Considerations. In cases where the state-
of-the-art new weapons and related sensors are available only in one country and an Inter 
Government Agreement is involved or considerations of strategic partnerships between 
countries are involved, the procedure set out in Chapter II shall be followed.

AoN validity period. Deviation from timelines tabulated above need to be apprised to 
VCNS/DG CG with due justification. 
 
Payment Terms 
 
52. 
The payment terms for each shipbuilding project would be negotiated and finalised by 
the CNC since these are dependent upon the indigenous and import content of the equipment 
fit. However, a broad suggested payment schedule, for fixed price element, is placed at 
Appendix A1, Appendix A2 and Appendix B for guidance. 
 
53. 
Payment terms for augmentation/ modernisation of shipyard infrastructure, where 
provided for, will be separately formulated and negotiated with shipyard and finalised by the 
DDP. 
 
54. 
The variable cost element, where applicable, will be paid on actuals, within the 
overall ceiling of total variable cost approved by CFA. Payment of variable cost element 
would be done through opening of a separate project account. Shipyard can make payments 
against negotiated cost during PNC, after submission of relevant documents.  
 
55. 
Monitoring of Projects/ Post Contract Management.  
After 
conclusion 
of 
contract, physical construction activity shall commence at the shipyard. Guidelines for post 
contract management in accordance with MoD ID No.1(1)/D(Acq)/17 dated 27 Feb 20 would 
also be applicable, as amended from time to time. All shipbuilding projects shall be 
monitored as follows: - 
 
(a) 
Six monthly review by an Apex Steering Committee under the Chairmanship 
of Defence Secretary as notified by MoD. 
 
(b) 
Committee under the chairmanship of CWP&A with members from MoD 
(Acquisition Wing/ DP/ Fin/ DGQA/ DGAQA/ DGNAI), Design/ Production

In case of ICG, the Committee would be headed by JS& AM (MS) with DDG 
(M&M), PD (Mat), FM (MS), ADG Acquisition Technical (MS) and CMD of 
concerned project as members. 
 
Delegation of Powers to Apex Steering Committee    
 
56. 
 To ensure efficient execution of the project, the Apex Steering committee shall be 
empowered with suitable delegation of powers (on lines of Project Management Boards in 
vogue currently for Defence Infrastructure Projects). This would help projects to be steered 
with necessary course corrections and timely overcoming procedural delays in the 
shipbuilding process rather than mere monitoring progress of work. 
 
57. 
Apex Steering Committee under chairmanship of Defence Secretary will consist of 
following: - 
 
(a) 
DG (Acquisition).  
 
(b) 
Additional Secretary (DP).

626 
 
58. 
The terms of reference of the Steering Committee shall be as follows: - 
 
(a) 
To review the physical progress of the project with specified reference to 
compliance of milestones laid down for completion of various activities of ship 
construction. 
 
(b) 
To monitor the financial progress of the project to ensure that the project 
progresses within the financial limits sanctioned by the Government. 
 
(c) 
To identify technical and administrative hold ups and give suitable directions 
so that the project proceeds as per the time schedule and cost approved by the 
Government. 
 
(d) 
To review fulfillment of contractual obligations at pre-determined stages. 
 
(e) 
To monitor commitments made by the shipyard in Build Strategy or during 
contract negotiations phase to meet the resource requirement of the new project 
together with other ongoing projects. 
 
(f) 
To examine anticipated expenditure likely to be incurred beyond the existing 
sanction, in exceptional cases in the interest of the project. 
 
(g) 
Any other matter requiring direction and guidance of the Steering Committee. 
 
59. 
The secretarial assistance for the committee will be provided by Naval System 
Division of Department of Defence Production. Apex Steering Committee will meet once in 
six months. 
 
Approval for Revised Project Cost 
 
60. 
After the project is approved by CCS, the MoD, SHQ/ICG HQ, and the shipyard will 
endeavor to ensure that the ship construction proceeds strictly as per the time schedule and 
cost approved by CCS. Since all the cost elements, both fixed and variable, including 
possible escalations on account of price, exchange rate variation, increase in statutory levies 
etc, are taken into consideration for estimating the project cost, there should not normally be 
any occasion/need for the project to slip either in time schedule or in cost. However, if due to 
any unavoidable circumstances, the project is likely to be delayed or the cost per ship as 
approved by CCS is likely to be exceeded, the procedure to be adopted for seeking approval 
of Competent Authority for the revised cost would be as per Order No. 1(1)/D(Acq)/17 dated 
27 Feb 20: - 
 
(a) 
Increase in project cost, which arises entirely due to change in statutory levies, 
exchange rate variation and price escalation within the originally approved project 
time cycle will be submitted to RM for approval. 

627 
 
(b) 
Increase in project cost up to 10% of the approved cost estimated by CCS 
(after excluding the increase due to statutory levies, exchange rate variation and price 
escalation within originally approved project time cycle) will also be submitted to RM 
for approval. 
 
(c) 
Increase in project cost exceeding 10% but upto 20% of the approved cost 
estimated by CCS (after excluding the increase due to statutory levies, exchange rate 
variation and price escalation within the approved project time cycle) will be 
submitted to RM and FM for approval. 
 
(d) 
Increase in project cost exceeding 20% of the approved cost estimated by CCS 
(after excluding increase due to statutory levies, exchange rate variation and price 
escalation within the approved project time cycle) due to reasons such as time 
overrun, under estimation, change in scope will be submitted to the CCS for approval.  
 
(e) 
Statutory levies’ means State and Central Taxes, including import and export 
duties as notified by Government of India and paid by the project authorities but 
excludes water, electricity charges and Petroleum, Oil & Lubricants (POL) price 
increases. 
 
(f) 
No expenditure beyond the existing sanction can be incurred unless the revised 
project cost is approved by the Competent Authority as indicated above. However, in 
exceptional cases, in the interest of the project, if such a necessity arises, the 
procedure set out in this section will be followed with approval of Apex Steering 
Committee based on recommendation of Revised Cost Committee.  
 
(g) 
In all cases where the revised project cost overrun is over 20% and is 
accompanied by time overrun of over 10%, while seeking approval of CCS for the 
revised cost estimates and time schedule, accountability aspects for such cost and time 
overruns should be fixed and indicated in the CCS Note.  
 
(h) 
Revised Cost Committee.  For fixing accountability, SHQ is to refer all cases 
with project cost overruns of over 20% and accompanied by time overrun of over 
10% to a Revised Cost Committee (RCC), under Chairmanship of CWP&A 
comprising representatives of Acquisition Wing and Advisor (Cost), prior putting up 
the second stage CCS proposal for consideration of CCS. Recommendations of the 
RCC shall be incorporated into the CCS Note. Action taken by SHQ would be 
monitored 
by 
the 
Vice 
Chief 
and 
periodically 
reviewed 
by 
Defence 
Secretary/DG(Acquisition). The composition of RCC would be as follows: - 
 
(i) 
CWP&A/ADGCG. 
 
(ii) 
Joint Secretary (NS), Member Secretary. 
 

628 
 
(iii) 
Joint Secretary & Acquisition Manager (MS). 
 
(iv) 
Additional FA &JS (Defence PSUs). 
 
(v) 
ADG Acquisition Technical (MS). 
 
(vi) 
Financial Manager (MS). 
 
(vii) 
DGND/ACCP/ACWP&A/ DG-P75 (as applicable). 
 
(viii) 
ACNS(P&P)/ Cmde (NP). 
 
(ix) 
ACNS(SR)/Cmde (SR). 
 
(x) 
CMD of concerned Shipyard. 
 
(xi) 
Director and Project Superintendents of concerned project of Shipyard. 
 
(xii) 
Cmde (ND) / Cmde (SP). 
 
(xiii) 
DDG (M&M), PD (Mat) and PD (SA) in case of ICG. 
 
Note: While the approval for enhancement of project cost/ time is being processed, the work 
on the project is to be progressed without waiting for the final approval. 
 
Closure of the Project 
 
61. 
The cost analysis of the first ship of the project, if required, shall be carried out by a 
team led by Advisor Cost MoD (DDP) within a period of 12 months from the second reading 
of the D-448 document check list, so that realistic and firm cost estimates for the other ships 
of the class can be worked out. 
 
62. 
Closure of all accounts related to construction of a particular ship of the project shall be 
carried out by COA/SHQ within 12 months from second reading of the D-448 document 
check list of the ship. Any pending shipyard liabilities at the time of account closure should 
be mutually valuated by the Committee. The valuated amount should be deducted from the 
last stage payment.  
 
63. 
The final closure of the ship construction project shall be carried out within the time 
schedule of 12 months from the second reading of the D-448 document check list of the last 
ship of the project. Where the final closure is not possible within the specified time frame, the 
approval of the competent authority at SHQ for extension of the time limit shall be taken. The 
final closure of the project is important so that the exact costing can be worked out and 
approvals for the follow-on projects can be obtained on a firm basis. 

629 
 
Liquidated Damages  
 
64. 
In case of delay in completion of the project and if the delay is attributable to the 
shipyard, Liquidated Damages will be levied after a Grace Period, as amplified below: - 
 
(a) 
Grace Period.  Grace period will be calculated at the rate of 5% of the build 
period (in months), subject to a minimum of one month and a maximum of three 
months.  
 
(b) 
Liquidated Damages.  Beyond the Grace Period, LD will be levied at the rate of 
1/100 of the delay percentage {Delay percentage = (Period of Delay wrt the build 
period, in month) x 100 / (Build Period in month as per contract)} of the vessel cost 
upto a limit of 10%, for every month of delay or part of a month delay (Any extension 
given by the buyer for delay attributable to buyer or Force Majeure Clause to be 
factored in delivery period). Vessel cost, excluding cost for BFE and B&D spares is as 
defined in the RFP placed at MoD ID www.mod-acq.in 
 
65. 
Applicability of LD would be as per the guidelines for post contract management in 
accordance with MoD ID No. 1(1)/D(Acq)/17 dated 27 Feb 20 would also be applicable, as 
amended time to time.

Production Agency (PA) shall be approved by AoN according authority based on 
recommendations of MoD DDP. Clauses in Chapter II covering ToT would apply in 
shipbuilding cases, as applicable. The PA can be selected from any of the public/private firms 
including a joint venture company based on the inputs from MoD DDP and, if required, from 
DRDO. The RFP in such cases would define the requirements of TOT depending upon the 

633 
 
depth of the technology which is required. Clauses related to ‘ownership of design’ or 
‘manufacture under license’ shall be clearly mentioned in the RFP. The nominated 
Production Agency (PA) for the receipt of technology will be closely associated in the 
preparation of RFP. 
 
73. 
RFP.   All issues related to terms and conditions of procurement would be amplified 
in RFP, which would be aligned as per finalised SRs. A standardised RFP on Shipbuilding is 
placed at MoD ID www.mod.nic.in. 
 
74. 
Closure of Project, LD, Deviations, Modifications, Contingencies, and 
Exemptions. For approval of cases for closure of Project, LD, Deviations and Exemptions, 
Modifications, Contingencies provisions of Section A would apply.  
 
75. 
Contract Administration and Post Contract Management and Monitoring.  
Contract administration and post contract management and monitoring would be undertaken 
by COA. Post contract management would be as per guidelines on contract management in 
accordance with MoD ID No. 1 (1)/D(Acq)/17 dated 27 Feb 20, as amended from time to 
time. All shipbuilding projects under this Section shall be monitored as follows: - 
 
(a)   Review by a Apex Steering Committee headed by DG (Acquisition) at MoD 
once in six months with members from MoD, MoD (Fin), Controlling Ministry of the 
shipyard {MoD (DP) in cases of DPSUs, MoS representatives in cases of PSUs, CMD 
of shipyard in cases of private shipyards}, CWP&A/ COA. The committee may co-
opt members as required.  
 
(b)   To ensure efficient execution of the project, the Apex Steering committee shall 
be empowered with suitable delegation of powers (on lines of Project Management 
Boards in vogue currently for Defence Infrastructure Projects). This would help the 
projects to be steered with necessary course corrections and timely overcoming 
procedural delays in the shipbuilding process rather than mere monitoring progress of 
work. The terms of reference of the Apex Steering Committee shall be as follows: - 
 
(i) 
To review physical progress of project with specified reference to 
compliance of milestones laid down for completion of various activities of 
ship construction. 
 
(ii) 
To monitor the financial progress of the project to ensure that the 
project progresses within the financial limits sanctioned by the Government.

78. 
Developmental Equipment.  The consideration of the developmental equipment may 
be undertaken as per procedure indicated in Section A of this Chapter. 
 
79. 
Payment Terms.  Ship production being an inherently complex process, needs to be 
divided into clearly identifiable/tangible stages for monitoring. The payments made to the 
shipyards therefore need to be set against achievement of these stages which need to be 
clearly verifiable. In this regard, Guidelines for Payment terms for ships would be in 
accordance with Appendix A1 and for submarines in accordance with Appendix A2. The 
Payment Terms for yard craft is at Appendix B. All payments for non- deliverables will be 
secured with Bank Guarantees. In case a shipyard does not claim a stage payment till delivery 
(and claims it post-delivery of vessel), there is no requirement to submit bank guarantee of 
equivalent amount at the time of claiming payment. The bank guarantee will be submitted by 
all shipyards, including DPSUs/PSUs, against non-deliverable stages. The deliverable stages 
would be defined in RFP. 
 
80. 
Build Strategy. The shipyard shall propose build strategy for required delivery 
schedules, yard infrastructure and available resources. Build strategy must be submitted by 
shipyard as part of RFP response. Build Strategy would include proposed construction 
schedule, Level 1 work breakdown structure, detailed master control plan with resource 
allocation plan for utilisation of shipyard manpower, infrastructure and committed 
infrastructure up-gradation specific to project, if applicable, outsourcing plan, the tentative 

635 
 
procurement schedule for major long lead items, including weapons and sensors and schedule 
for design documentation and drawings. This should also include shipyard’s plans to meet the 
resource requirements of the new project together with other on-going projects. Build 
Strategy would be deliberated during TEC/CNC and included in contract for further 
monitoring during post contract management. 
 
81. 
Detailed Design by Shipyard. On conclusion of contract, Shipyard shall commence 
Detailed Design, order equipment & material and obtain binding data for the detailed design. 
The actual construction of the ship may, however, start in parallel along with the process of 
detailed design. Then Preparatory period for the design of the ship may be in accordance with 
Section A.

Set-I and Set-II. FDD-I will be finalised prior to issue of RFP whereas FDD-II will be 
finalised and handed over to L1 Shipyard at the time of conclusion of contract. FDD–II 
would amplify the design specifications outlined in FDD-I and would be within the design 
envelop on which competitive bidding has been progressed. The requirements for design 
validation studies, consultancy services, development of Front End Engineering Design 
(FEED) if any, shall be projected to the AoN according authority, based on the proposal in 
SoC. 
  
87. 
Acceptance of Necessity (AoN).  The proposal for induction of the ships shall be 
linked to the Maritime Capability Perspective Plan (MCPP)/Five Years Plan which stipulates 
the numbers and type of vessels required. The Statement of Case for the proposal shall be 
prepared by SHQ and processed in line with the details given in Chapter II of DAP. This will 
inter alia contain Outline Staff Requirements, broad category of weapons and sensors to be 
fitted on the ship along with the status of their indigenous development if applicable, 
operational necessity, approximate cost, and budgetary provisions. The proposal shall clearly 
indicate whether it is a new design, Follow-on ships, or Follow-on ships with major 
design/equipment changes. Draft RFP is not mandatory to be enclosed along with the AoN.

94. 
Financial Parameters Evaluation by Team (FPET) & TEC. Prior to evaluation of 
the technical offers, the financial parameters evaluation will be undertaken by the FPET in 
accordance with the guidelines stipulated at Section B and Appendix C of this chapter. The 
technical offers of those firms which qualify FPE (Financial Parameters Evaluation) would be 
considered for the evaluation by the TEC.  
 
95. 
Commercial 
Negotiations 
by 
Contract 
Negotiation 
Committee 
(CNC). 
Finalisation on terms and conditions of contract along with price negotiations shall be 
undertaken with L1 shipyard and concluded by Contract Negotiation Committee (CNC), prior 
to seeking approval of CFA. 
 
96. 
New Design Ships/ Projects with Major Changes in Design/ Equipment.   In cases 
of new design ships as well as follow-on projects with major changes in design/ equipment, 
where it is not possible to estimate the likely firm cost of BNE equipment/ systems, the CFA 
approval will be taken separately on fixed cost component and cost component of BNE 
equipment/ systems. In such cases, based on the CFA approval, the work on shipbuilding, 
viz., ordering of equipment and material and development of detailed/ production design etc, 
and commencement of construction can start. The ordering of BNE equipment/ systems will 
be guided in accordance with diagram at Paragraph 46 of Section A to this Chapter. 
Thereafter, post firming up estimates of BNE equipment/ systems, second stage CFA 
approval of firmed up cost will be taken, within a period, as specified at the time of initial 
CFA approval. Guideline Specifications and Fixed cost component of the project are not to 
be revised/ changed during revision of cost of project post contract. Cost of BNE equipment/ 
systems of the project would not be utilised for purpose of L1 determination. RCC, if and as 
applicable will be constituted as per Section A to this Chapter. 
 
 

639 
 
Conclusion of Contract 
97. 
The contracts would be concluded on Fixed cost plus cost of BNE equipment/ systems, 
based upon the CFA approval, indicating inter alia fixed element and price of BNE 
equipment/ systems, exchange rate variations, increase in statutory levies etc. However, the 
cost of BNE equipment/ systems would be finalised at time of firming up of project cost for 
second stage CFA approval. 
 
98. 
The complete Functional Design Deliverable Set II shall be handed over by SHQ to the 
contracting shipyard at the time of conclusion of contract. 
 
99. 
The contract shall be signed within a period of two months from the date of CFA 
approval. In cases, where subsequent CFA approvals are necessitated, supplementary 
contracts shall be signed within two months of such approval. In view of the peculiarities 
associated with the design and construction of naval ships, illustrative contracts shall be 
promulgated separately by MoD/DDP in consultation with SHQ for guidance. 
 
100. Detailed Design by Shipyard.  On conclusion of contract, Shipyard shall commence 
Detailed Design, order equipment & material and obtain binding data for the detailed design. 
The Preparatory period for design of ship may be accorded in accordance with Article 42 of 
Section A.  
 
101. Contract Administration, Post Contract Management and Monitoring. The 
contract administration, post contract management and monitoring would be as per      
Section A. 
 
102. Apex Steering Committee.   To ensure efficient execution of the project, an apex 
steering committee with ToR as defined in Section A shall be set up to monitor the progress 
of ship building cases. 
 
103. 
Procurement of Shipborne Equipment. The procurement and nomination of 
equipment would be guided as per procedure specified at Section A. 
 
104. 
Procurement of Weapons and Related Sensors. The procedure for procurement of 
Weapons and Sensors would be as per procedure indicated in Section A. 
 
105. Field Trials.  Procedure for field trials would be as per procedure indicated in   
Section B. 
 
Payment Terms  
 
106. 
Ship production being an inherently complex process, needs to be divided into clearly 
identifiable/tangible stages for monitoring. The payments made to the shipyards therefore be 
against achievement of these stages. In this regard, a broad suggested payment schedule for 

640 
 
fixed price element, is placed at Appendix A-1, Appendix A-2 and Appendix B for 
guidance. All payments for non - deliverables will be secured with Bank Guarantees. In case 
a shipyard does not claim a stage payment till delivery (and claims it post-delivery of vessel), 
there is no requirement to submit bank guarantee of equivalent amount at the time of 
claiming payment. 
 
107. 
The cost of BNE equipment/ systems, where applicable, will be paid on actuals, 
within the overall ceiling of total cost approved by CFA. Payment of BNE equipment/ 
systems would be done through opening of a separate project account. Shipyard can make 
payments against actual cost incurred for procurement after submission of relevant 
documents. 
 
108. 
The bank guarantees will be submitted by all shipyards, including DPSUs, against 
non-deliverable stages. The deliverable stages will be defined in the RFP. 
 
Modification and Contingencies  
 
109. 
Modifications.  The construction of ships may require to accommodate unforeseen 
changes necessitated due to operational requirements of the user etc. Since it is not feasible to 
forecast these, provision would be made for the same while obtaining CCS/CFA approval. A 
percentage of basic cost of the vessels (excluding the cost of BNE / systems) will be included 
on ‘Not Exceeding Basis’ for modifications, subject to a maximum of 4%. Any extra time 
required beyond the delivery date of the ship, on account of modification would be restricted 
to a maximum of 4 % of the original contract delivery period under the project. Expenditure 
on each modification applicable to one / all ships of contract along with commensurate time 
extension (if any), will be approved by the concerned CFA based upon delegated financial 
powers in consultation with IFA.  
 
110. 
Contingencies. Contingencies for unforeseen expenditure of the project may be 
catered, subject to a ceiling of 1% of the basic cost of vessel (excluding the cost of BNE / 
systems) excluding taxes, duties and levies. The conditions of contingencies would be 
applicable as given in Section A of this Chapter.  
 
111. 
Approval for Revised Project Cost. After the project is approved by CFA, 
MoD/SHQ and the shipyard will endeavor to ensure that ship construction proceeds strictly 
as per time schedule and cost approved. Since projects under this section are on competitive 
bidding only change feasible post first stage CFA sanction is the firm cost of BNE / systems. 
Towards this, procedure outlined in Section A would be adopted. 
 
112. 
Closure of the Project. The procedure for closure of project would be as per 
procedure indicated in Section A.  
 
113. 
Liquidated Damages.   The procedure for implementation of LD would be guided as 
per procedure indicated in Section A.

GUIDELINES ON CAPACITY ASSESSMENT 
INDIAN SHIPBUILDING ENTITIES 
1. 
In accordance with Paragraphs 13, 70 and 92 of this Chapter, there is a need to 
undertake Capacity Assessment of a shipbuilding entity (shipyard/company/JV) prior 
recommending an entity for nomination/ issuance of RFPs for ship or yardcraft construction.  
This is aimed at determining the capability of the entity to undertake the intended 
shipbuilding activity.  The assessment would include technical & financial capacity/ 
capability including infrastructure of the entity.  Such an assessment would ensure that only 
entities with requisite capacity and capability are permitted to participate in the Indian Naval 
ship and yard craft building projects. 
2. 
Technical and Financial Assessment Parameters. 
(a) 
Technical Capacity Assessment (TCA) Parameters. Technical Capacity 
Assessment of the entities would be undertaken against objective parameters listed at 
Annexure I for each ship category.  It is mandatory for the bidder to qualify all 
parameters listed at Annexure I. 
(b) 
Financial Assessment Parameters.  Financial Assessment Parameters for 
each category of ship defined at Annexure II would be included in the EFP of the 
project.  Assessment of the financial status of the entity vis-à-vis the parameters 
indicated in the RFP would be undertake prior to commencement of TEC, by the 
Financial Parameter Evaluation team (FPET), constituted by SHQ with broad time 
frame for completion being 04 weeks from the date of opening of Technical Bids.  
FPET shall include a Finance member {Representative from the MoD (Fin) for non-
delegated power case(s) and representative form PIFA (Cap) for delegated power 
case(s)} in addition to listed TEC members, FPET would be completed within four 
weeks. For delegated power cases in all situations, FPET would be approved by 
the SHQ.  For MoD cases where all entities participating in the RFP are found 
complaint, the FPET report would be approved by the SHQ.  However, in case 
an entity or entities participating in the RFP are found non-complaint to the 
Financial Assessment Parameters, the FPET report would be approved by 
DG(Acquisition).  TEC would be progressed only for entities qualifying the 
stipulated financial parameters.  
3. 
Assessment of Entities. 
(a) 
Acquisition by Nomination. If validity of Technical Capacity Assessment of 
entities proposed for nomination by MoD for a particular project/ship category has 
expired, SHQ would undertake Technical Capacity Assessment of entities indicated, 

648 
 
against objective parameters listed at Annexure I.  Names of entities qualifying all 
Technical Parameters, shall be forwarded to MoD/DPP and MoD/Acquisition Wing 
prior processing the case for AoN. 
(b) 
Acquisition on Competitive Basis. The procedure for assessing the entities 
for undertaking a project on Competitive Basis is amplified in the subsequent 
paragraphs. 
4. 
Technical Capacity Assessment. 
The Technical Capacity Assessment of entities 
including DPSUs/PSUs/State PSUs and private entities would be undertaken as per the 
amplification orders to be issued by SHQ, by a Standing Committee comprising of the 
following and would be approved by CWP&A:- 
(a) 
ACCP/ACWP&A 
 
 
- 
Chairman 
(b) 
Commodore(SP) 
 
 
- 
Member 
(c) 
PD (Ship Acquisition)

Member 
(e) 
Representative SHQ/DNP 
 
- 
Member 
(f) 
Cdr(SP) 
 
 
 
- 
Member Secretary /SHQ 
5. 
Initiation of Technical Capacity Assessment (TCA). 
The Technical Capacity 
Assessment of entity would be coordinated by SHQ, on either of the following occasions for 
which amplifying orders shall be issued by SHQ:- 
(a) 
On application as new entity, or, on expiry of its existing validity. 
(b) 
If an entity whose Technical Capacity Assessment has not been undertaken 
over the last two years responds to the RFI for construction of a Naval/ICG 
vessel/yardcraft. 
(c) 
Entity responding for a project of a higher category (higher than the 
technically cleared lower category) subject to meeting the Technical parameters at 
Annexure I. 
(d) 
As and when deemed necessary by SHQ/MoD. 
6. 
Technical Capacity Assessment Procedure. 
As a part of fresh TCA, the 
technical assessment shall be undertaken as follows:- 
(a) 
Technical Capacity Assessment by Warship Overseeing Team (WOT). 
(i) 
Details of infrastructure available would be sought from entities by 
SHQ, to assess parameters provided in Annexure I to these Guidelines.  

649 
 
Entities failing to provide all relevant documents within three months of the 
notice would be given an additional month for submitting the requisite 
documents, failing which, entity would be declared ‘Not Qualified’ and 
would not be eligible for participating in any RFP (for ship categories for 
which valid TCA Certificate is not held) for the next six months, or, till 
obtaining TCA certificate for SHQ, whichever is later. 
(ii) 
The relevant WOT shall carry out initial technical capacity assessment 
of the entity’s capacity and capability. 
(iii) The Technical Capacity Assessment would entail physical inspection 
of the entity’s facilities and infrastructure, to validate the TCA pro-forma/ 
inputs submitted by the entity. 
(iv) The initial technical capacity assessment report, along with the 
nominated WOT recommendations, would be forwarded to SHQ for appraisal 
and approval. 
(b) 
Technical Capacity Assessment Report. 
(i) 
The Standing Committee would thereafter study the initial Technical 
Capacity Assessment report and visit the concerned entity, as necessary, as 
per the amplification orders to be issued by SHQ. 
(ii) 
Additional members, where and if required, may be co-opted into the 
committee, to validated specific issues/aspects of the entity being assessed. 
(iii) 
If the entity is found suitable, a Technical Capacity Assessment 
(TCA) certificate shall be issued by SHQ, indicating the maximum light ship 
displacement, LOA, beam, draught and air draught (as applicable), along 
with the approved categorisation for which the entity has been cleared, based 
on the entity’s infrastructure.  The TCA to be issued within 45 days of receipt 
of all documents, shall remain valid for two years from the date of issue. 
(iv) 
If any entity is found unsuitable, it shall be informed of areas on 
which they have been disqualified. 
7. 
RFPs for construction of warships and yardcraft are to be issued only to entities with a 
valid Technical Capacity Assessment certificate for type/category of vessel cleared.  Entities 
failing to either submit complete documents within the stipulated period of three months, or 
failing to meet the stipulated criteria, would  not be considered for issuance of RFP (for ship 
categories for which valid TCA Certificate is not held), for the next six months or till 
obtaining TCA certificate, whichever is later. 
8. 
Re-validation of Technical Capacity Assessment. The entity is required to forward 
to IHQ MoD (N)/ DSP, all requisite documents as per the TCA proforma, three months prior 

650 
 
to expiry of Technical Capacity Assessment.  In the eventuality of an entity  not submitting 
valid documents or an entity whose TCA is pending at SHQ due to non-submission of 
complete documents, the entity would be given an additional month for submitting the 
requisite documents, failing which the entity would be declared ‘Not Qualified’ and would 
not be eligible for participating in any RFP (for ship categories for which valid TCA 
Certificate is not held) for the next six months, or till obtaining TCA certificate from SHQ, 
whichever is later.
