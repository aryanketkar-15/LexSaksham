8 
Sample Professional Services Contract 
 
 
 
 
 
    
Authority’s Local Conflict of Interest Code and the California Political Reform Act.  This 
contract does not require or permit Contractor to make a governmental decision as specified in 2 
Cal. Code of Regs. § 18701, subdiv. (a)(2)(A), or serve in a staff capacity as specified in 2 Cal. 
Code of Regs.  § 18701, subdiv. (a)(2)(B). 
 
[OPTION 2:  The Water Authority has determined, based on the scope of the services to be

Contractor’s employees the status of a “designated employee” or “Consultant” of the Water

INDEMNIFICATION:      
 
(a) 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Contractor shall (1) immediately defend, and 
(2) indemnify the Water Authority, and its directors, officers, and employees from and against all 
liabilities regardless of nature or type arising out of or resulting from Contractor’s performance 
of services under this contract, or any negligent or wrongful act or omission of the Contractor or 
Contractor’s officers, employees, agents, or subcontractors.  Liabilities subject to the duties to 
defend and indemnify include, without limitation all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, 
and judgments; associated investigation and administrative expenses; defense costs, including 
but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees; court costs; and costs of alternative dispute 
resolution. The Contractor’s obligation to indemnify applies unless it is adjudicated that its 
liability was caused by the sole active negligence or sole willful misconduct of an indemnified 
party. If it is finally adjudicated that liability is caused by the comparative active negligence or 
willful misconduct of an indemnified party, the Contractor’s indemnification obligation shall be 
reduced in proportion to the established comparative liability of the indemnified party.   
 
(b) 
The duty to defend is a separate and distinct obligation from the Contractor’s duty to 
indemnify.  The Contractor shall be obligated to defend, in all legal, equitable, administrative, or 
special proceedings, with counsel approved by the Water Authority, the Water Authority and its 
directors, officers, and employees, immediately upon tender to the Contractor of the claim in any 
form or at any stage of an action or proceeding, whether or not liability is established.  An 
allegation or determination of comparative active negligence or willful misconduct by an 
indemnified party does not relieve the Contractor from its separate and distinct obligation to 

 
9 
Sample Professional Services Contract 
 
 
 
 
 
    
defend Water Authority.   The obligation to defend extends through final judgment, including 
exhaustion of any appeals.  The defense obligation includes an obligation to provide independent 
defense counsel if the Contractor asserts that liability is caused in whole or in part by the 
negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified party.  If it is finally adjudicated that 
liability was caused by the sole active negligence or sole willful misconduct of an indemnified 
party, Contractor may submit a claim to the Water Authority for reimbursement of reasonable 
attorneys’ fees and defense costs.  
 
(c) 
The review, acceptance or approval of the Contractor’s work or work product by any 
indemnified party shall not affect, relieve or reduce the Contractor’s indemnification or defense 
obligations. This Section survives completion of the services or the termination of this contract.  
The provisions of this Section are not limited by and do not affect the provisions of this contract 
relating to insurance.

SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS:      
 
All terms, conditions, and provisions of this contract shall apply to and bind the respective heirs, 
executors, administrators, successors, and assigns of the parties.  Nothing in this paragraph is 
intended to affect the limitation on assignment. 
 
24. 
DAMAGE OR LOSS OF EQUIPMENT OR FACILITIES: 
 
(a) 
General Obligation. Contractor shall pay to the Water Authority the replacement cost of 
any equipment or repair cost of any facilities provided by the Water Authority for Contractor’s 
use in performance of services that is lost or damaged by Contractor or Contractor’s officers, 
employees, agents or subcontractors.    
      
 
(b)  
Keys.  During the term of the contract, Contractor may be issued keys to Water Authority 

 
12 
Sample Professional Services Contract 
 
 
 
 
 
    
facilities in order to perform the scope of work.  Keys shall not be loaned, duplicated, or given to 
anyone not authorized to have the keys.  Contractor will sign for each key and each key will be 
returned to the project manager when access to that area is no longer authorized, or at the end of 
the contract term, whichever is applicable.  Should keys become lost or stolen, Contractor shall 
immediately notify the Contract Manager.  A charge will be assessed for all expenses incurred by 
the Water Authority, including the replacement of locks, lock cores, keys, and other materials 
necessary to ensure the Water Authority security level is returned to the same level existing prior 
to the loss of the key(s). The cost of replacing locks may be as much as $40,000. 
 
25. 
ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS:  
 
During the course of this contract, communications may occur through sending, receiving or 
exchanging electronic versions of documents and e-mails using commercially available computer 
software and Internet access.    Contractor and the Water Authority acknowledge that the Internet 
is occasionally victimized by the creation and dissemination of so-called viruses, or similar 
destructive electronic programs.  Contractor and the Water Authority view the issues raised by 
these viruses seriously and have invested in document and e-mail scanning software that identify 
and reject files containing known viruses.  Contractor agrees to update its system with the 
software vendor’s most current releases at regular intervals.  Because of the virus scanning 
software, the respective computer systems of the parties may occasionally reject a 
communication.  The parties acknowledge that this occurrence is to be expected as part of the 
ordinary course of business.  Because the virus protection industry is generally one or two steps 
behind new viruses, neither party can guarantee that its respective communications and 
documents will be virus free.  Occasionally, a virus will escape and go undetected as it is passed 
from system to system.  Although each party will use all reasonable efforts to assure that its 
communications are virus free, neither party warrants that its documents will be virus free.  Each 
party agrees to advise the other if it discovers a virus in its respective system that may have been 
communicated to the other party. 
 
26.
