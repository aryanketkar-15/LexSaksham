Completion of Services Template Guide

Overview
You may prepare your own Completion of Services Agreement starting with the template below.This template is designed to be used once the services sold have been rendered in full.  The intended use is to obtain written acknowledgement that the services provided were successfully completed as described. This form could provide added protection during the dispute process, as certain chargeback types require written acknowledgement from the buyer that services were completed as described.  

How to Use the Contract Template 
When you see Purple text delete the purple and input the information it requests. 

Tips

When you are done, change all font colors back to “black.”
If you are attaching this contract to a Square Invoice, you will have to save the finalized agreement in PDF format locally on your system. 
Once it is saved as a PDF file, you can attach the file to the Square Invoice to send to your customer using the “Add Attachment” button under “More Options” in the invoice. 

Within the template, there is a section in the header prompting you for your business contact information. We highly recommend always including this information so that your customer can sign the document and return it to you since they are unable to re-upload the attachment back to the invoice for return.
