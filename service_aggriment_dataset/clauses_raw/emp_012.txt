REV.: APR 2012 
1. LEGAL STATUS OF THE PARTIES: The United Nations and the Contractor shall also each be referred to as a 
“Party” hereunder, and: 
1.1 Pursuant, inter alia, to the Charter of the United Nations and the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities 
of the United Nations, the United Nations, including its subsidiary organs, has full juridical personality and 
enjoys such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent fulfillment of its purposes. 
1.2 The Contractor shall have the legal status of an independent contractor vis-à-vis the United Nations, and nothing 
contained in or relating to the Contract shall be construed as establishing or creating between the Parties the 
relationship of employer and employee or of principal and agent.  The officials, representatives, employees, or 
subcontractors of each of the Parties shall not be considered in any respect as being the employees or agents of 
the other Party, and each Party shall be solely responsible for all claims arising out of or relating to its 
engagement of such persons or entities. 
2. RESPONSIBILITY FOR EMPLOYEES:  To the extent that the Contract involves the provision of any services to the 
United Nations by the Contractor’s officials, employees, agents, servants, subcontractors and other representatives 
(collectively, the Contractor’s “personnel”), the following provisions shall apply: 
2.1 The Contractor shall be responsible for the professional and technical competence of the personnel it assigns to 
perform work under the Contract and will select reliable and competent individuals who will be able to 
effectively perform the obligations under the Contract and who, while doing so, will respect the local laws and 
customs and conform to a high standard of moral and ethical conduct. 
2.2 Such Contractor personnel shall be professionally qualified and, if required to work with officials or staff of the 
United Nations, shall be able to do so effectively.  The qualifications of any personnel whom the Contractor 
may assign or may propose to assign to perform any obligations under the Contract shall be substantially the 
same, or better, as the qualifications of any personnel originally proposed by the Contractor. 
2.3 At the option of and in the sole discretion of the United Nations: 
2.3.1 the qualifications of personnel proposed by the Contractor (e.g., a curriculum vitae)  may be 
reviewed by the United Nations prior to such personnel’s performing any obligations under the 
Contract; 
2.3.2 any personnel proposed by the Contractor to perform obligations under the Contract may be 
interviewed by qualified staff or officials of the United Nations prior to such personnel’s performing 
any obligations under the Contract; and, 
2.3.3 in cases in which, pursuant to Article 2.3.1 or 2.3.2, above, the United Nations has reviewed the 
qualifications of such Contractor’s personnel, the United Nations may reasonably refuse to accept 
any such personnel. 
2.4 Requirements specified in the Contract regarding the number or qualifications of the Contractor’s personnel 
may change during the course of performance of the Contract.  Any such change shall be made only following 
written notice of such proposed change and upon written agreement between the Parties regarding such change, 
subject to the following: 
2.4.1 The United Nations may, at any time, request, in writing, the withdrawal or replacement of any of the 
Contractor’s personnel, and such request shall not be unreasonably refused by the Contractor. 
2.4.2 Any of the Contractor’s personnel assigned to perform obligations under the Contract shall not be 
withdrawn or replaced without the prior written consent of the United Nations, which shall not be 
unreasonably withheld.

2.4.3 The withdrawal or replacement of the Contractor’s personnel shall be carried out as quickly as 
possible and in a manner that will not adversely affect the performance of obligations under the 
Contract. 
2.4.4 All expenses related to the withdrawal or replacement of the Contractor’s personnel shall, in all 
cases, be borne exclusively by the Contractor. 
2.4.5 Any request by the United Nations for the withdrawal or replacement of the Contractor’s personnel 
shall not be considered to be a termination, in whole or in part, of the Contract, and the United 
Nations shall not bear any liability in respect of such withdrawn or replaced personnel. 
2.4.6 If a request for the withdrawal or replacement of the Contractor’s personnel is not based upon a 
default by or failure on the part of the Contractor to perform its obligations in accordance with the 
Contract, the misconduct of the personnel, or the inability of such personnel to reasonably work 
together with United Nations officials and staff, then the Contractor shall not be liable by reason of 
any such request for the withdrawal or replacement of the Contractor’s personnel for any delay in the 
performance by the Contractor of its obligations under the Contract that is substantially the result of 
such personnel’s being withdrawn or replaced. 
2.5 Nothing in Articles 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4, above, shall be construed to create any obligations on the part of the United 
Nations with respect to the Contractor’s personnel assigned to perform work under the Contract, and such 
personnel shall remain the sole responsibility of the Contractor. 
2.6 The Contractor shall be responsible for requiring that all personnel assigned by it to perform any obligations 
under the Contract and who may have access to any premises or other property of the United Nations shall: 
2.6.1 undergo or comply with security screening requirements made known to the Contractor by the 
United Nations, including but not limited to, a review of any criminal history;  
2.6.2 when within United Nations premises or on United Nations property, display such identification as 
may be approved and furnished by the United Nations security officials, and that upon the 
withdrawal or replacement of any such personnel or upon termination or completion of the Contract, 
such personnel shall immediately return any such identification to the United Nations for 
cancellation. 
2.7 Within one working day after learning that any of Contractor’s personnel who have access to any United 
Nations premises have been charged by law enforcement authorities with an offense other than a minor traffic 
offense, the Contractor shall provide written notice to inform the United Nations about the particulars of the 
charges then known and shall continue to inform the United Nations concerning all substantial developments 
regarding the disposition of such charges.  
2.8 All operations of the Contractor, including without limitation, storage of equipment, materials, supplies and 
parts, within United Nations premises or on United Nations property shall be confined to areas authorized or 
approved by the United Nations.  The Contractor’s personnel shall not enter or pass through and shall not store 
or dispose of any of its equipment or materials in any areas within United Nations premises or on United 
Nations property without appropriate authorization from the United Nations. 
3. ASSIGNMENT: 
3.1 Except as provided in Article 3.2, below, the Contractor may not assign, transfer, pledge or make any other 
disposition of the Contract, of any part of the Contract, or of any of the rights, claims or obligations under the 
Contract except with the prior written authorization of the UN.  Any such unauthorized assignment, transfer, 
pledge or other disposition, or any attempt to do so, shall not be binding on the United Nations.  Except as 
permitted with respect to any approved subcontractors, the Contractor shall not delegate any of its obligations 
under this Contract, except with the prior written consent of the UN.  Any such unauthorized delegation, or 
attempt to do so, shall not be binding on the United Nations. 
3.2 The Contractor may assign or otherwise transfer the Contract to the surviving entity resulting from a 
reorganization of the Contractor’s operations, provided that: 
3.2.1 such reorganization is not the result of any bankruptcy, receivership or other similar proceedings;

Contractor’s assets or ownership interests; and, 
3.2.3 the Contractor promptly notifies the United Nations about such assignment or transfer at the earliest 
opportunity; and, 
3.2.4 the assignee or transferee agrees in writing to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the 
Contract, and such writing is promptly provided to the United Nations following the assignment or 
transfer. 
4. SUBCONTRACTING:  In the event that the Contractor requires the services of subcontractors to perform any 
obligations under the Contract, the Contractor shall obtain the prior written approval of the United Nations.  The United 
Nations shall be entitled, in its sole discretion, to review the qualifications of any subcontractors and to reject any 
proposed subcontractor that the United Nations reasonably considers is not qualified to perform obligations under the 
Contract.  The United Nations shall have the right to require any subcontractor’s removal from United Nations premises 
without having to give any justification therefor.  Any such rejection or request for removal shall not, in and of itself, 
entitle the Contractor to claim any delays in the performance, or to assert any excuses for the non-performance, of any of 
its obligations under the Contract, and the Contractor shall be solely responsible for all services and obligations 
performed by its subcontractors.  The terms of any subcontract shall be subject to, and shall be construed in a manner 
that is fully in accordance with, all of the terms and conditions of the Contract. 
5. INDEMNIFICATION: 
5.1 The Contractor shall indemnify, defend, and hold and save harmless, the United Nations, and its officials, 
agents and employees, from and against all suits, proceedings, claims, demands, losses and liability of any kind 
or nature brought by any third party against the United Nations, including, but not limited to, all litigation costs 
and expenses, attorney’s fees, settlement payments and damages, based on, arising from, or relating to: 
5.1.1 allegations or claims that the possession of or use by the United Nations of any patented device, any 
copyrighted material, or any other goods, property or services provided or licensed to the United 
Nations under the terms of the Contract, in whole or in part, separately or in a combination 
contemplated by the Contractor’s published specifications therefor, or otherwise specifically 
approved by the Contractor, constitutes an infringement of any patent, copyright, trademark, or other 
intellectual property right of any third party; or, 
5.1.2 any acts or omissions of the Contractor, or of any subcontractor or anyone directly or indirectly 
employed by them in the performance of the Contract, which give rise to legal liability to anyone not 
a party to the Contract, including, without limitation, claims and liability in the nature of a claim for 
workers’ compensation. 
5.2 The indemnity set forth in Article 5.1.1, above, shall not apply to: 
5.2.1 A claim of infringement resulting from the Contractor’s compliance with specific written instructions 
by the United Nations directing a change in the specifications for the goods, property, materials, 
equipment or supplies to be or used, or directing a manner of performance of the Contract or 
requiring the use of specifications not normally used by the Contractor; or 
5.2.2 A claim of infringement resulting from additions to or changes in any goods, property, materials 
equipment, supplies or any components thereof furnished under the Contract if the United Nations or 
another party acting under the direction of the United Nations made such changes. 
5.3 In addition to the indemnity obligations set forth in this Article 5, the Contractor shall be obligated, at its sole 
expense, to defend the United Nations and its officials, agents and employees, pursuant to this Article 5, 
regardless of whether the suits, proceedings, claims and demands in question actually give rise to or otherwise 
result in any loss or liability. 
5.4 The United Nations shall advise the Contractor about any such suits, proceedings, claims, demands, losses or 
liability within a reasonable period of time after having received actual notice thereof.  The Contractor shall 
have sole control of the defense of any such suit, proceeding, claim or demand and of all negotiations in 
connection with the settlement or compromise thereof, except with respect to the assertion or defense of the 
privileges and immunities of the United Nations or any matter relating thereto, for which only the United

Nations itself is authorized to assert and maintain.  The United Nations shall have the right, at its own expense, 
to be represented in any such suit, proceeding, claim or demand by independent counsel of its own choosing. 
5.5 In the event the use by the United Nations of any goods, property or services provided or licensed to the United 
Nations by the Contractor, in whole or in part, in any suit or proceeding, is for any reason enjoined, temporarily 
or permanently, or is found to infringe any patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property right, or in 
the event of a settlement, is enjoined, limited or otherwise interfered with, then the Contractor, at its sole cost 
and expense, shall, promptly, either: 
5.5.1 procure for the United Nations the unrestricted right to continue using such goods or services 
provided to the United Nations; 
5.5.2 replace or modify the goods or services provided to the United Nations, or part thereof, with the 
equivalent or better goods or services, or part thereof, that is non-infringing; or,

indirectly employed by the Contractor or any of its subcontractors in the performance of the Contract. 
6.2 Unless otherwise provided in the Contract, prior to commencement of performance of any other obligations 
under the Contract, and subject to any limits set forth in the Contract, the Contractor shall take out and shall 
maintain for the entire term of the Contract, for any extension thereof, and for a period following any 
termination of the Contract reasonably adequate to deal with losses: 
6.2.1 insurance against all risks in respect of its property and any equipment used for the performance of 
the Contract; 
6.2.2 workers’ compensation insurance, or its equivalent, or employer’s liability insurance, or its 
equivalent, with respect to the Contractor’s personnel sufficient to cover all claims for injury, death 
and disability, or any other benefits required to be paid by law, in connection with the performance 
of the Contract; 
6.2.3 liability insurance in an adequate amount to cover all claims, including, but not limited to, claims for 
death and bodily injury, products and completed operations liability, loss of or damage to property, 
and personal and advertising injury, arising from or in connection with the Contractor’s performance 
under the Contract, including, but not limited to, liability arising out of or in connection with the acts 
or omissions of the Contractor, its personnel, agents, or invitees, or the use, during the performance 
of the Contract, of any vehicles, boats, airplanes or other transportation vehicles and equipment, 
whether or not owned by the Contractor; and, 
6.2.4 such other insurance as may be agreed upon in writing between the United Nations and the 
Contractor. 
6.3 The Contractor’s liability policies shall also cover subcontractors and all defense costs and shall contain a 
standard “cross liability” clause.

and approved by the United Nations, in its sole discretion, for purposes of fulfilling the Contractor’s 
requirements for providing insurance under the Contract, the insurance policies required under the Contract 
shall: 
6.5.1 name the United Nations as an additional insured under the liability policies, including, if required, 
as a separate endorsement under the policy;

Nations;  
6.5.3 provide that the United Nations shall receive written notice from the Contractor’s insurance carrier 
not less than thirty (30) days prior to any cancellation or material change of coverage; and,

financial standing and that are acceptable to the United Nations.  Prior to the commencement of any obligations 
under the Contract, the Contractor shall provide the United Nations with evidence, in the form of certificate of 
insurance or such other form as the United Nations may reasonably require, that demonstrates that the 
Contractor has taken out insurance in accordance with the requirements of the Contract.  The United Nations 
reserves the right, upon written notice to the Contractor, to obtain copies of any insurance policies or insurance

provisions of Article 6.5.3, above, the Contractor shall promptly notify the United Nations concerning any 
cancellation or material change of insurance coverage required under the Contract. 
6.8 The Contractor acknowledges and agrees that neither the requirement for taking out and maintaining insurance 
as set forth in the Contract nor the amount of any such insurance, including, but not limited to, any deductible or 
retention relating thereto, shall in any way be construed as limiting the Contractor’s liability arising under or 
relating to the Contract. 
7. ENCUMBRANCES AND LIENS:  The Contractor shall not cause or permit any lien, attachment or other encumbrance 
by any person to be placed on file or to remain on file in any public office or on file with the United Nations against any

furnished under the Contract, or by reason of any other claim or demand against the Contractor or the United Nations. 
8. EQUIPMENT FURNISHED BY THE UNITED NATIONS TO THE CONTRACTOR:  Title to any equipment and 
supplies that may be furnished by the United Nations to the Contractor for the performance of any obligations under the 
Contract shall rest with the United Nations, and any such equipment shall be returned to the United Nations at the 
conclusion of the Contract or when no longer needed by the Contractor.  Such equipment, when returned to the United 
Nations, shall be in the same condition as when delivered to the Contractor, subject to normal wear and tear, and the 
Contractor shall be liable to compensate the United Nations for the actual costs of any loss of, damage to, or degradation 
of the equipment that is beyond normal wear and tear. 
9. COPYRIGHT, PATENTS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS: 
9.1  Except as is otherwise expressly provided in writing in the Contract, the United Nations shall be entitled to all 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights including, but not limited to, patents, copyrights, and

materials which the Contractor has developed for the United Nations under the Contract and which bear a 
direct relation to or are produced or prepared or collected in consequence of, or during the course of, the 
performance of the Contract.  The Contractor acknowledges and agrees that such products, documents and 
other materials constitute works made for hire for the United Nations. 
9.2  To the extent that any such intellectual property or other proprietary rights consist of any intellectual property 
or other proprietary rights of the Contractor: (i) that pre-existed the performance by the Contractor of its 
obligations under the Contract, or (ii) that the Contractor may develop or acquire, or may have developed or 
acquired, independently of the performance of its obligations under the Contract, the United Nations does not 
and shall not claim any ownership interest thereto, and the Contractor grants to the United Nations a perpetual 
license to use such intellectual property or other proprietary right solely for the purposes of and in accordance 
with the requirements of the Contract. 
9.3  At the request of the United Nations, the Contractor shall take all necessary steps, execute all necessary 
documents and generally assist in securing such proprietary rights and transferring or licensing them to the 
United Nations in compliance with the requirements of the applicable law and of the Contract.

any such disclosure is made. 
11.4 The United Nations may disclose Information to the extent as required pursuant to the Charter of the United

12. FORCE MAJEURE; OTHER CHANGES IN CONDITIONS: 
12.1 In the event of and as soon as possible after the occurrence of any cause constituting force majeure, the 
affected Party shall give notice and full particulars in writing to the other Party, of such occurrence or cause if 
the affected Party is thereby rendered unable, wholly or in part, to perform its obligations and meet its 
responsibilities under the Contract.  The affected Party shall also notify the other Party of any other changes in 
condition or the occurrence of any event which interferes or threatens to interfere with its performance of the 
Contract.  Not more than fifteen (15) days following the provision of such notice of force majeure or other 
changes in condition or occurrence, the affected Party shall also submit a statement to the other Party of 
estimated expenditures that will likely be incurred for the duration of the change in condition or the event of 
force majeure.  On receipt of the notice or notices required hereunder, the Party not affected by the occurrence 
of a cause constituting force majeure shall take such action as it reasonably considers to be appropriate or 
necessary in the circumstances, including the granting to the affected Party of a reasonable extension of time 
in which to perform any obligations under the Contract. 
12.2 If the Contractor is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by reason of force majeure to perform its obligations 
and meet its responsibilities under the Contract, the United Nations shall have the right to suspend or terminate 
the Contract on the same terms and conditions as are provided for in Article 13, “Termination,” except that the 
period of notice shall be seven (7) days instead of thirty (30) days.  In any case, the United Nations shall be 
entitled to consider the Contractor permanently unable to perform its obligations under the Contract in case the 
Contractor is unable to perform its obligations, wholly or in part, by reason of force majeure for any period  in 
excess of ninety (90) days. 
12.3 Force majeure as used herein means any unforeseeable and irresistible act of nature, any act of war (whether 
declared or not), invasion, revolution, insurrection, terrorism, or any other acts of a similar nature or force, 
provided that such acts arise from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the 
Contractor.  The Contractor acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to any obligations under the Contract 
that the Contractor must perform in areas in which the United Nations is engaged in, preparing to engage in, or 
disengaging from any peacekeeping, humanitarian or similar operations, any delays or failure to perform such 
obligations arising from or relating to harsh conditions within such areas, or to any incidents of civil unrest 
occurring in such areas, shall not, in and of itself, constitute force majeure under the Contract. 
13. TERMINATION: 
13.1 Either Party may terminate the Contract for cause, in whole or in part, upon thirty (30) day’s notice, in writing, 
to the other Party.  The initiation of conciliation or arbitral proceedings in accordance with Article 16 
“Settlement of Disputes,” below, shall not be deemed to be a “cause” for or otherwise to be in itself a 
termination of the Contract. 
13.2 The United Nations may terminate the Contract at any time by providing written notice to the Contractor in 
any case in which the mandate of the United Nations applicable to the performance of the Contract or the 
funding of the United Nations applicable to the Contract is curtailed or terminated, whether in whole or in 
part.  In addition, unless otherwise provided by the Contract, upon sixty (60) day’s advance written notice to 
the Contractor, the United Nations may terminate the Contract without having to provide any justification 
therefor.   
13.3 In the event of any termination of the Contract, upon receipt of notice of termination that has been issued by 
the United Nations, the Contractor shall, except as may be directed by the United Nations in the notice of 
termination or otherwise in writing: 
13.3.1 
take immediate steps to bring the performance of any obligations under the Contract to a close in a 
prompt and orderly manner, and in doing so, reduce expenses to a minimum; 
13.3.2 
refrain from undertaking any further or additional commitments under the Contract as of and 
following the date of receipt of such notice; 
13.3.3 
place no further subcontracts or orders for materials, services, or facilities, except as the United 
Nations and the Contractor agree in writing are necessary to complete any portion of the Contract 
that is not terminated; 
13.3.4 
terminate all subcontracts or orders to the extent they relate to the portion of the Contract 
terminated;

written accountings from the Contractor concerning all obligations performed or pending in accordance with 
the Contract.  In addition, the United Nations shall not be liable to pay the Contractor except for those goods 
delivered and services provided to the United Nations in accordance with the requirements of the Contract, but

of notice of termination from the United Nations or prior to the Contractor’s tendering of notice of termination 
to the United Nations.

forthwith in the event that: 
13.5.1

moratorium or stay on any payment or repayment obligations, or applies to be declared insolvent;

and costs, including, but not limited to, all costs incurred by the United Nations in any legal or non-legal 
proceedings, as a result of any of the events specified in Article 13.5, above, and resulting from or relating to a 
termination of the Contract, even if the Contractor is adjudged bankrupt, or is granted a moratorium or stay or 
is declared insolvent.  The Contractor shall immediately inform the United Nations of the occurrence of any of 
the events specified in Article 13.5, above, and shall provide the United Nations with any information 
pertinent thereto. 
13.7 The provisions of this Article 13 are without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the United Nations 
under the Contract or otherwise. 
14. NON-WAIVER OF RIGHTS:  The failure by either Party to exercise any rights available to it, whether under the

any remedy associated therewith, and shall not relieve the Parties of any of their obligations under the Contract. 
15. NON-EXCLUSIVITY:  Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, the United Nations shall have no obligation to 
purchase any minimum quantities of goods or services from the Contractor, and the United Nations shall have no

Parties wish to seek such an amicable settlement through conciliation, the conciliation shall take place in 
accordance with the Conciliation Rules then obtaining of the United Nations Commission on International 
Trade Law (“UNCITRAL”), or according to such other procedure as may be agreed between the Parties in 
writing. 
16.2 ARBITRATION:  Any dispute, controversy, or claim between the Parties arising out of the Contract or the 
breach, termination, or invalidity thereof, unless settled amicably under Article 16.1, above, within sixty (60) 
days after receipt by one Party of the other Party’s written request for such amicable settlement, shall be 
referred by either Party to arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules then obtaining.  
The decisions of the arbitral tribunal shall be based on general principles of international commercial law.  
The arbitral tribunal shall be empowered to order the return or destruction of goods or any property, whether 
tangible or intangible, or of any confidential information provided under the Contract, order the termination of 
the Contract, or order that any other protective measures be taken with respect to the goods, services or any 
other property, whether tangible or intangible, or of any confidential information provided under the Contract, 
as appropriate, all in accordance with the authority of the arbitral tribunal pursuant to Article 26 (“Interim 
measures”) and Article 34 (“Form and effect of the award”) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.  The 
arbitral tribunal shall have no authority to award punitive damages.  In addition, unless otherwise expressly 
provided in the Contract, the arbitral tribunal shall have no authority to award interest in excess of the London 
Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) then prevailing, and any such interest shall be simple interest only.  The 
Parties shall be bound by any arbitration award rendered as a result of such arbitration as the final adjudication 
of any such dispute, controversy, or claim. 
17. PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES: Nothing in or relating to the Contract shall be deemed a waiver, express or 
implied, of any of the privileges and immunities of the United Nations, including its subsidiary organs. 
18. TAX EXEMPTION: 
18.1 Article II, Section 7, of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations provides, inter 
alia, that the United Nations, including its subsidiary organs, is exempt from all direct taxes, except charges 
for public utility services, and is exempt from customs restrictions, duties, and charges of a similar nature in 
respect of articles imported or exported for its official use.  In the event any governmental authority refuses to 
recognize the exemptions of the United Nations from such taxes, restrictions, duties, or charges, the Contractor 
shall immediately consult with the United Nations to determine a mutually acceptable procedure. 
18.2 The Contractor authorizes the United Nations to deduct from the Contractor’s invoices any amount 
representing such taxes, duties or charges, unless the Contractor has consulted with the United Nations before 
the payment thereof and the United Nations has, in each instance, specifically authorized the Contractor to pay 
such taxes, duties, or charges under written protest.  In that event, the Contractor shall provide the United 
Nations with written evidence that payment of such taxes, duties or charges has been made and appropriately 
authorized, and the United Nations shall reimburse the Contractor for any such taxes, duties, or charges so 
authorized by the United Nations and paid by the Contractor under written protest. 
19. MODIFICATIONS: 
19.1 Pursuant to the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, only the Chief of the United Nations 
Procurement Division, or such other Contracting authority as the United Nations has made known to the 
Contractor in writing, possesses the authority to agree on behalf of the United Nations to any modification of 
or change in the Contract, to a waiver of any of its provisions or to any additional contractual relationship of 
any kind with the Contractor.  Accordingly, no modification or change in the Contract shall be valid and 
enforceable against the United Nations unless provided by a valid written amendment to the Contract signed 
by the Contractor and the Chief of the United Nations Procurement Division or such other contracting 
authority. 
19.2 If the Contract shall be extended for additional periods in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
Contract, the terms and conditions applicable to any such extended term of the Contract shall be the same 
terms and conditions as set forth in the Contract, unless the Parties shall have agreed otherwise pursuant to a 
valid amendment concluded in accordance with Article 19.1, above.

19.3 The terms or conditions of any supplemental undertakings, licenses, or other forms of agreement concerning 
any goods or services provided under the Contract shall not be valid and enforceable against the United 
Nations nor in any way shall constitute an agreement by the United Nations thereto unless any such 
undertakings, licenses or other forms are the subject of a valid amendment concluded in accordance with 
Article 19.1, above. 
20. AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS: 
20.1 Each invoice paid by the United Nations shall be subject to a post-payment audit by auditors, whether internal 
or external, of the United Nations or by other authorized and qualified agents of the United Nations at any 
time during the term of the Contract and for a period of three (3) years following the expiration or prior 
termination of the Contract.  The United Nations shall be entitled to a refund from the Contractor for any 
amounts shown by such audits to have been paid by the United Nations other than in accordance with the 
terms and conditions of the Contract. 
20.2 The United Nations may conduct investigations relating to any aspect of the Contract or the award thereof, the 
obligations performed under the Contract, and the operations of the Contractor generally relating to 
performance of the Contract at any time during the term of the Contract and for a period of three (3) years 
following the expiration or prior termination of the Contract.  
20.3  The Contractor shall provide its full and timely cooperation with any such inspections, post-payment audits or 
investigations.  Such cooperation shall include, but shall not be limited to, the Contractor’s obligation to make 
available its personnel and any relevant documentation for such purposes at reasonable times and on 
reasonable conditions and to grant to the United Nations access to the Contractor’s premises at reasonable 
times and on reasonable conditions in connection with such access to the Contractor’s personnel and relevant 
documentation.  The Contractor shall require its agents, including, but not limited to, the Contractor’s 
attorneys, accountants or other advisers, to reasonably cooperate with any inspections, post-payment audits or 
investigations carried out by the United Nations hereunder. 
21. LIMITATION ON ACTIONS: 
21.1 Except with respect to any indemnification obligations in Article 5, above, or as are otherwise set forth in the 
Contract, any arbitral proceedings in accordance with Article 16.2, above, arising out of the Contract must be 
commenced within three years after the cause of action has accrued. 
21.2 The Parties further acknowledge and agree that, for these purposes, a cause of action shall accrue when the 
breach actually occurs, or, in the case of latent defects, when the injured Party knew or should have known all 
of the essential elements of the cause of action, or in the case of a breach of warranty, when tender of delivery 
is made, except that, if a warranty extends to future performance of the goods or any process or system and the 
discovery of the breach consequently must await the time when such goods or other process or system is ready 
to perform in accordance with the requirements of the Contract, the cause of action accrues when such time of 
future performance actually begins. 
22. ESSENTIAL TERMS: The Contractor acknowledges and agrees that each of the provisions in Articles 23 to 28 
hereof constitutes an essential term of the Contract and that any breach of any of these provisions shall entitle the 
United Nations to terminate the Contract or any other contract with the United Nations immediately upon notice to 
the Contractor, without any liability for termination charges or any other liability of any kind. 
23. SOURCE OF INSTRUCTIONS: The Contractor shall neither seek nor accept instructions from any authority external 
to the United Nations in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Contract.  Should any authority 
external to the United Nations seek to impose any instructions concerning or restrictions on the Contractor’s performance 
under the Contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the United Nations and provide all reasonable assistance 
required by the United Nations.  The Contractor shall not take any action in respect of the performance of its obligations 
under the Contract that may adversely affect the interests of the United Nations, and the Contractor shall perform its 
obligations under the Contract with the fullest regard to the interests of the United Nations. 
24. OFFICIALS NOT TO BENEFIT: The Contractor warrants that it has not and shall not offer to any representative, 
official, employee, or other agent of the United Nations any direct or indirect benefit arising from or related to the 
performance of the Contract or of any other contract with the United Nations or the award thereof or for any other 
purpose intended to gain an advantage for the Contractor.

    28.1   The Contractor shall take all appropriate measures to prevent sexual exploitation or abuse of anyone by its 
employees or any other persons engaged and controlled by the Contractor to perform any services under the 
Contract.  For these purposes, sexual activity with any person less than eighteen years of age, regardless of 
any laws relating to consent, shall constitute the sexual exploitation and abuse of such person.  In addition, the 
Contractor shall refrain from, and shall take all reasonable and appropriate measures to prohibit its employees 
or other persons engaged and controlled by it from exchanging any money, goods, services, or other things of 
value, for sexual favors or activities, or from engaging any sexual activities that are exploitive or degrading to 
any person.   
     28.2   The United Nations shall not apply the foregoing standard relating to age in any case in which the Contractor’s 
personnel or any other person who may be engaged by the Contractor to perform any services under the 
Contract is married to the person less than the age of eighteen years with whom sexual activity has occurred 
and in which such marriage is recognized as valid under the laws of the country of citizenship of such 
Contractor’s personnel or such other person who may be engaged by the Contractor to perform any services 
under the Contract.
