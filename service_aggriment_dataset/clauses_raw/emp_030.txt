Wholesale Order/Delivery Form Template Guide

Overview
You may prepare your own order/delivery form starting with the template below to fit your business needs and use it as the agreement you enter into with your clients.

How to Use the Order/Delivery Template 
When you see Purple text delete the purple and input the information it requests. 

The Red text lists options you need to select from to detail the agreement with your client or provides optional text for you to include. Remove any clauses that are not relevant for your final agreement.

The tables created are intended to serve as a template for you to populate the items available for order from your business. If you require additional line items in a particular table, insert as many rows as applicable. If your customer is filling out this order form, then please be sure to provide them with the necessary supplementary information to do so (e.g. catering menu). 

Tips

Change all font colors back to “black.”
If you are attaching this contract to a Square Invoice, you will have to save the finalized agreement in PDF format locally on your system. 
Once it is saved as a PDF file, you can attach the file to the Square Invoice to send to your customer using the “Add Attachment” button under “More Options” in the invoice. 
You should obtain your client’s initials in each designated space.
You and your client should both sign and date the agreement.

Within the contract template, there is a section in the header prompting you for your business contact information. We highly recommend always including this information so that your customer can sign the document and return it to you since they are unable to re-upload the attachment back to the invoice for return.
