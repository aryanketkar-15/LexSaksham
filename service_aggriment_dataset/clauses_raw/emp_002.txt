mode. This ensures that the application, as well as data is available to the customers with high availability. 
 
c. Data Availability: The deployment architecture ensures that the same data is available on multiple servers. In the 
event of data issues, data can be recreated with no data loss from the other servers. 
 
d. Backups: Backups are taken every day and retained for varying periods of time (daily, weekly and yearly). Backed-
up data is available off-site. Backup recovery tests are performed at regular intervals to ensure integrity of backups.
