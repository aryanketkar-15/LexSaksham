  
 
Professional Services Agreement 
 
THIS PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”)  is made by and 
between Cornell University, a New York not-for-profit education corporation, (“Cornell”) on behalf of its 
____________________________________________________________________ (“College/Unit”), 
and ____________________________________________________________________ (“Consultant”) 
as of the Effective Date.  
 
For good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows: 
 
1. 
General Purpose. The general purpose of this Agreement is to engage the services of Consultant 
to perform the services and provide the deliverables described in Schedule A (the “Services” or “Scope of 
Services”). The surrounding facts and circumstances are more fully set out in the attached: 
Schedule A (Scope of Services), Schedule B (Project Timetable and Task Description), Schedule C 
(Payment Amount and Schedule), Schedule D (Consultant’s Personnel), and Appendix 1 (Insurance 
Requirements), all of which are incorporated by this reference. 
 
2. 
General Duties of Consultant.  
 
2.1 
Consultant shall perform the Services in accordance with the attached Schedules and in 
accordance with professional standards for performing services of a similar kind. Consultant warrants that 
all persons assigned by Consultant to the performance of this Agreement (or any specified subcontractor) 
are fully qualified to perform the Services required. Cornell has assigned a representative (“Cornell’s 
Representative”) to provide direction to Consultant with respect to the Services. Consultant’s personnel 
who will perform the Services are listed in Schedule D. Consultant may not replace or reassign such 
personnel without the prior written consent of Cornell’s Representative. If applicable, Consultant shall 
replace personnel with a person having at least equivalent experience and qualifications. Cornell shall 
have the right to review and approve such replacement personnel. 
2.2 
Subject to Section 2.1 above, Consultant may assign the performance of any portion of the 
Services to a subcontractor; provided that Consultant shall be fully responsible for any and all acts and 
omissions of any subcontractor in connection with the performance of this Agreement. All terms, 
conditions and requirements of this Agreement will apply without qualification to any services performed 
or goods provided by any subcontractor. 
 
3. 
Period of Performance. Consultant agrees that all Services provided under this Agreement shall 
commence on ________________, 20____ and be completed no later than ________________, 20____ 
(the “Term”). Consultant shall adhere to the timetable in Schedule B unless such period is otherwise 
extended by Cornell in writing. Consultant shall be responsible to Cornell for any damage caused by its 
failure to comply with the timetable. 
 
4. 
Compensation. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Cornell shall pay 
Consultant an amount not to exceed $____________________ in exchange for the Services. The schedule 
of payments is contained in Schedule C. Consultant shall submit all invoices to Cornell Accounts 
Payable, 377 Pine Tree Road, Ithaca, NY 14850 or emailed to dfa-4040_invoice@cornell.edu, referencing 
the purchase order number. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the total amount 
payable by Cornell for the Services will be determined by applying the stated rate of compensation to the 
services actually performed by Consultant. Consultant will not render the Services and Cornell will not be 
required to pay for any services in excess of the amount stipulated above, unless Consultant has first 
secured prior written approval from Cornell through a contract amendment.

5.
Payment Terms. Consultant shall be paid after Cornell’s receipt from Consultant of properly
prepared invoices in accordance with Cornell’s invoicing instructions as further set forth below in this
Section. Cornell may make adjustments to Consultant’s invoice due to shortages, rejection, or other
failure to comply with the provisions of this Agreement. Discount periods, if any, shall commence after
the latest of final acceptance, delivery, receipt of any required documentation, or receipt of invoice.
Delays in receiving the invoice, errors or omissions on the invoice, or lack of supporting documentation
required by the terms of this Agreement will be cause for withholding settlement without losing prompt
payment discount privilege. Invoices must be accompanied by transportation receipt if transportation is
payable as a separate item. Consultant shall submit an original invoice to Cornell promptly after each
shipment, if applicable, in accordance with the instructions on the purchase order. If Consultant elects to
use paper or email invoices, all payments are due either (i) within sixty (60) days following Cornell’s
receipt of the invoice if receiving check payments, or (ii) forty-five (45) days following Cornell’s receipt
of the invoice if Consultant is enrolled to receive direct deposit payments. If Consultant elects to register
for electronic invoicing and direct deposit payments through the Automated Clearing House (ACH), then
all payments are due Net 30 days after the receipt of invoice.
6.
Tax Withholding for Domestic and Foreign Consultants. All payments from Cornell to
Consultant under this Agreement may be subject to tax withholding. Cornell reserves the sole right and
discretion to withhold tax where it believes it is required to do so under the tax laws of any jurisdiction.
By accepting this Agreement, the Consultant is relinquishing all claims against Cornell for any amounts
withheld and remitted by Cornell to a tax authority. It is the Consultant’s sole responsibility to provide
Cornell with timely, complete, accurate, and legible forms and/or documents necessary to claim a
reduction or elimination of withholding taxes (e.g., Form W-8BEN). Cornell reserves the sole right and
discretion to make the determinations as well as whether such forms and/or documents are sufficient to
reduce or eliminate withholding tax on any payment to the Consultant.
7.
Independent Contractor Status. Consultant is an independent contractor and not an employee,
partner, or joint venturer of Cornell. Consultant is not an agent of Cornell, nor is it authorized to transact
business, enter into agreements, or otherwise make commitments on behalf of Cornell, unless expressly
authorized in writing by an authorized representative of Cornell. Cornell will not pay or withhold federal,
state, or local income tax or other payroll tax of any kind on behalf of Consultant or its employees.
Consultant is not eligible for, not entitled to, and shall not participate in any of Cornell’s pension, health,
or other benefit plans. Consultant is solely responsible for the payment of all required payroll taxes,
whether federal, state, or local in nature, including, but not limited to income taxes, Social Security taxes,
Federal Unemployment Compensation taxes, and any other fees, charges, licenses, or payments required
by law.
8.
Use of Cornell Data. Cornell shall retain, as between the parties, exclusive ownership of all data,
material, books, records, and information in any format or medium (including provided orally) submitted
or made available to Consultant by Cornell or by any other person acting on behalf of Cornell
(collectively, “Cornell Data”), unless otherwise publicly available. Subject to terms and conditions
contained in Section 11. Intellectual Property, Consultant is granted a limited, non-transferable, non-
sublicensable, nonexclusive license to use such Cornell Data solely for the purpose of performing its
obligations under this Agreement. Consultant will provide access to Cornell Data only to those Consultant
employees, subcontractors and agents who need to access the data to fulfill Consultant’s obligations under
this Agreement. Consultant shall not access or use Cornell Data to create aggregated or de-identified
data nor use Cornell Data as training data in generative artificial intelligence systems unless
directed by Cornell. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, Consultant will return to Cornell
in a readily usable format, remove, or securely delete or destroy, as directed by Cornell, all Cornell Data.

9.
Access to Data, Response to Legal Demands or Requests for Data.
9.1 
Cornell shall have the right, at all times during the Term of this Agreement, to access, copy and/or 
remove any and all Cornell Data and information from Consultant. In addition, in connection with 
Cornell’s response to an e-discovery request or other legal proceeding, governmental request, or other a 
claim or demand upon receipt of written request from Cornell, Consultant will provide Cornell with any 
existing logs or other Cornell Data and information upon receipt of a written request from Cornell. 
9.2  
If Consultant (a) files a petition seeking to take advantage of any law relating to bankruptcy or 
insolvency, (b) is adjudicated to be bankrupt, (c) is the subject of a petition seeking liquidation, 
reorganization, winding-up, dissolution or adjustment of indebtedness, (d) becomes insolvent or makes an 
assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (e) has a receiver appointed on its behalf, Consultant will return 
in a readily usable format, remove, or destroy, as directed by Cornell, all Cornell Data and information. 
9.3  
Upon receipt of valid legal process (the “Legal Request”) seeking Cornell Data, Consultant will 
attempt to redirect the requesting third party to Cornell and/or request that the third party notify Cornell of 
its Legal Request. If Consultant’s redirecting efforts are unsuccessful, and provided Consultant is not 
prohibited by law from doing so, Consultant will provide commercially reasonable notice to Cornell of 
the Legal Request, prior to disclosure of any Cornell Data, which would include, to the extent permitted 
by law, a copy of the Legal Request received by Consultant from the third party. Consultant will 
thereafter respond to the Legal Request in the time permitted unless Cornell has taken appropriate legal 
steps (e.g., Motion to Quash or Motion for a Protective Order) to stop or limit Consultant’s response. 
9.4 
If any legal process is served on Cornell to which Cornell intends to respond, then Consultant will 
provide Cornell with access to any Cornell Data in Consultant’s possession together with any necessary 
encryption keys. If Cornell is unable to access any Cornell Data using the tools and documentation 
provided by Consultant, then, upon request, Consultant will provide commercially reasonable assistance 
to enable Cornell to obtain the Cornell Data. 
10.
Confidentiality.
10.1 
Consultant shall not directly or indirectly disseminate or otherwise disclose, deliver, or make 
available to any person outside its organization any Confidential Information (as defined below) without 
Cornell’s prior, express, written consent or as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement. 
Consultant shall protect Confidential Information with the same degree of care used to protect its own 
proprietary or confidential information from unauthorized use or disclosure, which shall not be less than a 
reasonable degree of care. Consultant shall use Confidential Information solely for purposes of its 
performance of the Services and shall not use Confidential Information for any other purpose without the 
prior written consent of Cornell. Consultant may disclose Confidential Information only to persons within 
its organization who have a need to receive such Confidential Information in order to perform 
Consultant’s obligations under this Agreement and who are bound by confidentiality and non-use 
obligations with respect to the Confidential Information in a manner that is consistent with the terms of 
this Section.  
10.2 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Consultant’s obligations with respect to Confidential Information 
shall not apply to any information that: (a) is or becomes publicly available in a manner not involving 
Consultant’s violation of this Agreement or any other agreement to which Consultant is a party; (b) was 
known to Consultant at the time it was disclosed, other than by previous disclosure by or on behalf of 
Cornell, as evidenced by Consultant’s written records at the time of disclosure; (c) is independently 
developed by Consultant outside the scope of this Agreement without use of or reference to any 
Confidential Information; or (d) is lawfully and in good faith made available to Consultant by third 

Professional Services Agreement -Cornell Rev. 4/28/2025 
4 
persons without the breach of any confidentiality obligation of which Consultant is or reasonable should 
be aware.  
10.3 
As used in this Agreement, the term “Confidential Information” means all information disclosed 
by or on behalf of Cornell to Consultant in connection with this Agreement or Consultant’s performance 
of the Services, whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should 
be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of 
disclosure.Confidential Information includes, without limitation, the terms of this Agreement; work 
performed and deliverables provided by Consultant to Cornell pursuant to this Agreement; Cornell Data; 
Cornell’s scientific, technical, trade or business information; information pertaining to Cornell’s 
information security, physical security, network security, systems security, or staff security; Cornell’s 
business, development, or construction needs, plans, methods, or proposals; and financial information. 
10.4 
If required by law or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, then Consultant may disclose 
Confidential Information to a governmental authority, provided that Consultant shall: (i) make reasonable 
efforts to give Cornell notice of such requirement prior to disclosure (which must include a copy of any 
applicable subpoena or order) in order to permit Cornell to obtain, at its own expense, protective 
treatment of such Confidential Information and (ii) limit the disclosure only to such portion of the 
Confidential Information that it is required by law or such court order to disclose. If Consultant breaches 
its confidentiality obligations, Cornell shall have all rights available to it at law and in equity to enforce 
the provisions in this Section including, but not limited to, applying to a court of competent jurisdiction 
for specific performance and/or injunctive relief.  
10.5 
The obligations of this Section shall expressly survive the expiration or earlier termination of this 
Agreement. 
11.

11.1. 
Ownership.
11.1.1. Cornell shall own all information, deliverables, and other work product developed, created, 
produced, or otherwise obtained by Consultant pursuant to this Agreement. 
11.1.2. Any copyrightable work (“Work”) developed in the course of Consultant’s performance under 
this Agreement shall be deemed “work made for hire” under federal copyright law and all interests in 
such Work shall belong to Cornell. To the extent any such Work does not constitute a “work made for 
hire” under copyright law, Consultant hereby grants, transfers, assigns, and conveys to Cornell and its 
successors and assigns the entire right, title, and interest in the Work or any part of the Work, including 
but not limited to, the right to: reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute by sale, license or other 
transfer, perform publicly, display, and to secure copyrights or patents and renewals, reissues, and 
extensions of any such copyrights or patents in the United States of America or any foreign country. 
11.1.3. Any patentable invention conceived or reduced to practice in the course of Consultant’s 
performance under this Agreement shall be the property of Cornell, and Cornell has the right to secure 
patents, reissues, and extensions of the same in the United States of America or any foreign country.

America or any foreign country shall be at the sole discretion of Cornell. 
11.1.4. Consultant agrees to cooperate fully with Cornell in the preparation and execution of all 
documents necessary or incidental to the assignment in this Section and the protection 
and preservation of rights herein granted to Cornell. The obligations of this Section shall

5 
expressly survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement. 
 
11.1.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Consultant owns and shall retain ownership to all of its pre-
existing intellectual property, including all rights, title, and interest to inventive intellectual property 
conceived or acquired by Consultant external to or pre-dating this Agreement consistent with U.S. patent

connection with the Services. Consultant hereby grants to Cornell a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
non-terminable, fully transferable, royalty-free, fully paid up right and license to use any Background IP 
incorporated into the Services or any deliverable. All Services and deliverables exclusive of Consultant’s 
Background IP shall be owned by Cornell to the extent such remainder is functionally separable. Nothing 
in this Agreement shall restrict Cornell from owning any ideas, concepts, know-how, techniques, or 
experience developed by its personnel while carrying out the Services under this Agreement. This 
Agreement does not give Consultant any rights, implied or otherwise, information, or intellectual 
property, except as expressly stated in this Agreement.  
 
11.1.6. If Consultant includes third-party owned assets in the deliverables (“Third-Party Assets”), 
Consultant shall obtain all licenses for such Third-Party Assets from the rights holder for inclusion in the 
deliverables. Upon Cornell’s request, Consultant will provide Cornell with the source from which it 
obtained such Third-Party Assets and, as an alternative, Cornell may request to negotiate and obtain 
licenses directly from the source of the Third-Party Assets if deemed necessary by Cornell. 
 
11.2. 
Non-infringement Warranty. Consultant warrants and represents that the Services and all work 
provided under this Agreement will not infringe, individually or collectively, any patent, copyright, trade 
secret, or other proprietary right of any third party; and Consultant has no reason to believe that any 
patent, copyright, trade secret, or other proprietary right of any third party may be infringed by 
Consultant’s provision of the Services and any work under this Agreement.

(i)  the other party’s non-performance or other breach of the Agreement if not cured within thirty (30) 
days. 
 
(ii) Conflict of Interest between a Cornell employee and Consultant. For purposes of this Agreement, a 
“Conflict of Interest” may be deemed present if, in Cornell’s reasonable judgment, a Cornell employee 
who reviews, approves, or administratively manages this Agreement and/or a member of such Cornell 
employee’s family has a significant financial interest in the Consultant, is directly involved in performing 
obligations under this Agreement on behalf of Consultant, or receives any personal financial advantage or 
compensation from this transaction. In this Section, the terms “family” and “significant financial interest” 
have the same meaning as defined in the university conflicts of interest policy. 
 
(iii) In the event of any suspension of payment or the institution of any proceedings by or against the 
other party voluntary or involuntary, in bankruptcy or insolvency, or under the provisions of the Federal 
Bankruptcy Act, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or an assignee for the benefit of creditors 
of the property of the other party.

with copies of any and all Work in progress and complete Work created in the course and scope of this 
Agreement on or before the date of termination. Except in the event of termination for cause, Consultant

any, and explicitly waives any right to additional or other amounts of any kind, including based on 
quantum meruit or other similar theory. 
 
14.

trustees, officers, agents, and employees from all liability, suits, actions, or claims of any character, name, 
or description including reasonable attorneys’ fees, brought on account of any injuries or damage, or loss 
(real or alleged) received or sustained by any person, persons, or property, arising out of the Services or 
any other work provided under this Agreement, and/or Consultant’s failure to perform or comply with any 
requirements of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claims for personal injury, property 
damage, breach of warranty, or infringement of copyright, patent, or other proprietary right. Consultant 
indemnifies Cornell, and its agents, officers, employees and trustees, and holds each harmless against any 
fines, damages, assessments, or attorney fees in the event a court or administrative agency shall find that 
Consultant or anyone or entity engaged through Consultant is an employee of Cornell. Cornell reserves 
the right to retain whatever funds which would be due to Consultant under this Agreement until such 
suits, action or actions, claim or claims for injuries or damages as aforesaid are settled and satisfactory 
evidence to that effect furnished. These obligations shall expressly survive the expiration or earlier 
termination of this Agreement.  
 
15. 
Insurance.  
 
15.1.  Insurance Coverages. Consultant shall procure and carry insurance to financially support 
indemnification of Cornell as provided herein, and shall provide certificates of such insurance, upon 
request. Annual automatic renewals of the certificate(s) of insurance must be requested from the

insurance coverages in Appendix 1, Insurance Requirements. 
 
15.2.  Other Insurance-Related Requirements. 
 
15.2.1. The limits of insurance stated in Appendix 1 for each type of insurance are minimum limits only; 
if any policy provided by Consultant provides limits greater than those stated, then the additional insureds 
will be entitled to the full limits of such policy and this Agreement shall be deemed to require such full 
limits. Except with respect to Professional Liability, all policies shall contain a waiver of subrogation. 
Consultant shall be responsible for all deductibles under its policies and all defense costs if its policies do 
not cover such expenses. 
 
15.2.2. All policies required to be maintained shall be issued by an insurance company licensed or 
authorized to do business in New York State with a rating of A- VII or better by A.M. Best. 
 
15.2.3. All contractors and subcontractors used by the Consultant to provide Services under this 
Agreement shall be required to comply with the insurance requirements in this Agreement. 
 
15.2.4. Insurance coverage in the minimum amounts shall not relieve the Consultant or any of its 
subcontractors of any liability, nor shall it preclude Cornell from exercising any rights or taking such 
other actions as are available to it under the law. 
 

Professional Services Agreement -Cornell Rev. 4/28/2025

15.2.5. A Certificate of Insurance is required evidencing all coverages outlined above prior to

written (10 days in the case of non-payment) notice of cancellation, non-renewal, or other change in 
coverage. 
15.2.6. Cornell reserves the right to require additional coverage or to increase limits depending upon the 
liability exposure in the scope of work in this Agreement. 
15.2.7. Cornell’s failure to enforce these requirements shall not be considered a waiver of the 
requirements. Any changes to these requirements shall only be made in writing and agreed upon by all 
parties. 
15.2.8.  Consultant shall not do or permit anything to be done that would invalidate the insurance policies 
required herein.

applicable Cornell University regulations and policies, and all applicable federal, state, and local laws and 
regulations. Further, Consultant, its employees, contractors and agents shall act at all times in a 
professional and ethical manner, and shall not engage in harassing, retaliatory, or discriminatory behavior 
of any kind. If Consultant violates any of these obligations or otherwise engages in behavior on Cornell 
property that is considered to be detrimental to students or Cornell, or for any other reason in Cornell’s 
sole discretion, Cornell shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without prior notice. Prior to 
gaining access to Cornell’s facilities in order to perform Services, Consultant personnel will execute 
Cornell’s document(s) required for access privileges and at all times act in compliance with Cornell’s 
policies and procedures. Consultant and all individuals assigned by Consultant to a project under this 
Agreement must comply with Cornell policies.
17.

request Consultant will provide to Cornell a copy of its written polic(ies) or other documentation to 
comply with Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 503) and the Vietnam Era Veterans 
Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA) and implementing federal regulations.
18.
Advertisement. Consultant may not use the name Cornell or any variation of the Cornell name, 
including logos and trademarks of any kind, or those of any of Cornell’s colleges, divisions, departments, 
or programs, for advertising or publicity purposes without first obtaining the written consent of Cornell in 
each instance.
19.
Inspection and Right to Audit. Cornell shall at all times have access to review the ongoing work 
of Consultant for purposes of inspecting the same and determining that the Services are being performed 
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Throughout the Term of this Agreement, and for a period 
of three years after the later of final payment, expiration or termination, or longer if required by law, 
Cornell, at its own expense, shall be entitled to perform, or to have performed by a third party of Cornell’s 
choosing, during normal business hours and upon ten (10) days’ notice, an on-site audit of any and all 
relevant records of Consultant necessary to permit Cornell to evaluate and verify Consultant’s compliance 
with the requirements of this Agreement. Consultant grants Cornell permission to view and/or copy any 
books, documents, records, data, and information (including data and information stored in electronic 
form) of Consultant which relate to or have been used in connection with the performance of this 
Agreement. Consultant also grants Cornell permission to interview Consultant’s staff and agents as part of 
the audit. If applicable, Consultant agrees to provide Cornell with adequate and appropriate workspace for 
conducting the audit. If Cornell, in its sole discretion, determines that an on-site audit is not necessary, 
Consultant agrees to complete, within thirty (30) days of receipt, an audit questionnaire provided by

Professional Services Agreement -Cornell Rev. 4/28/2025 
8 
Cornell. Consultant shall refund to Cornell any overcharges discovered by Cornell, or by a third party of 
Cornell’s choosing, within thirty (30) days following Consultant’s acceptance of Cornell’s written 
notification of audit findings. Consultant may not unreasonably withhold or delay acceptance of audit 
findings. Consultant shall include this audit provision in any subcontracts that it may issue under this 
Agreement. 
20.
FERPA and HIPAA Compliance.
20.1. 
FERPA. To the extent that performance of the Services under this Agreement involves disclosure 
to Consultant of personally identifiable information from student education records protected by the 
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (“Student Information”), the following obligations 
shall apply. Consultant acknowledges that for the purposes of this Agreement, it will be designated as a 
“school official” with “legitimate educational interests” in the Student Information, as those terms have 
been defined under FERPA and its implementing regulations, and Consultant agrees to abide by the 
limitations and requirements imposed by 34 CFR 99.33(a) on school officials. Consultant will use Student 
Information only for the specific purpose of fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement. Consultant 
may not disclose Student Information to or share any Student Information with any other party or for any 
other purpose without the prior written consent of the student. Without limiting the foregoing, Consultant 
will not use such information for Consultant’s own benefit or engage in “data mining” of Cornell Data or 
communications, whether through automated or human means, except as necessary to fulfill its specific 
obligations under this Agreement. Consultant agrees that prior to releasing any Student Information to any 
subcontractor or agent, Consultant will require such subcontractor or agent to agree in writing to terms 
substantively similar to the obligations in this Section. Promptly following the termination or expiration 
of this Agreement, Consultant shall return to Cornell or certify in writing to Cornell the destruction of all 
Student Information (including that provided to or obtained by its subcontractors or agents) disclosed to 
Consultant in connection with this Agreement.  
20.2. 
HIPAA. If Cornell determines that Consultant’s performance under this Agreement requires 
compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Consultant agrees to 
enter into any and all additional documents or amendments Cornell deems necessary to address HIPAA 
compliance, including, without limitation, a Business Associate Agreement in substantially the form 
provided by Cornell. 
21.
Compliance with Personal Data Protection and Privacy Laws. Consultant will comply in all
respects with applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy and the collection, processing, and use of
personal data, including those of the United States and any other country to the extent applicable to the
processing of personal data under this Agreement (together, the “Privacy Laws”). Consultant agrees to
process personal data for which Cornell is the controller (as defined under any applicable Privacy Law)
only to the extent necessary to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and to implement and
maintain appropriate technical and administrative safeguards (as defined in the applicable Privacy Laws)
to prevent the unauthorized access, use or disclosure of such data. Consultant further agrees to allow
Cornell staff or representatives to examine such measures upon request, and to take all reasonable steps to
ensure the reliability of any Consultant personnel who will have access to personal data. Without
prejudice to Consultant’s obligations set out above, Consultant will report to Cornell within forty-eight
(48) hours any loss, damage, or destruction of any personal data processed under this Agreement for
which Cornell is a controller, regardless of whether such personal data constitutes Cornell Data. If
required or deemed advisable for compliance with the Privacy Laws, then Cornell and the Consultant
agree to execute Cornell’s Personal Data Processing Agreement (PDPA) or other required documentation
under applicable Privacy Laws. For purposes of this Section, “personal data” means information relating
to an identified or identifiable individual, and an “identifiable individual” means one who can be
identified, directly or indirectly, by use of any identifier or characteristic specific to that individual.

22. 
Export Control Compliance. Consultant acknowledges that it is subject to U.S. export control 
laws and regulations (collectively, “Export Control Laws”), which include (without limitation) the 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), and 
regulations and orders administered by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(“OFAC Regulations”). Consultant agrees to comply with all Export Control Laws. Consultant shall not 
disclose any technology or technical data subject to Export Control Laws unless and until a plan for the 
transfer, use, dissemination, and control of the information has been approved in writing by Cornell’s 
Export Control Office. Furthermore, Consultant represents and warrants that it is not an entity or 
individual identified on, or owned by a party identified on, any denied or restricted party list under Export 
Control Laws. 
 
23. 
Force Majeure. A Party shall be excused from liability for its failure or delay in performance of 
an obligation under this Agreement to the extent the failure or delay results from causes beyond that 
party’s reasonable control including, but not limited to, a fire, a flood, an explosion, an earthquake, a 
natural disaster or any other act of God, as well as a pandemic, an epidemic, a recognized health threat as 
determined by any federal, state or local government or quasi-governmental authority (including the 
federal Centers for Disease Control), civil unrest, a strike or labor disturbance, war or threat of war, 
terrorism or a threat of terrorism, a governmental or quasi-governmental order or directive to “shelter in 
place”, or any other event, occurrence, order or directive similar to those enumerated above (each, a 
“Force Majeure Event”). A Force Majeure Event may also include a then-current order, policy, rule or 
regulation imposed by Cornell University based upon the health and safety of its student body, faculty, 
staff and/or broader community. A party seeking to rely on this provision shall (i) use reasonable diligence 
to remove the condition that prevents performance and shall not be entitled to suspend performance of its 
obligations in any greater scope or for any longer duration than is required by the Force Majeure event, 
(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of such Force Majeure Event, remedy 
its inability to perform, and resume full performance of its obligations under this Agreement, and (iii) 
promptly provide notice of failure or delay in performance due to a Force Majeure Event to the other 
party, including anticipated impact on performance and efforts to mitigate the failure or delay. The party 
shall provide such notice within ten (10) days prior to the required performance unless the circumstances 
and/or conditions giving rise to the Force Majeure Event necessitate a shorter notice period. 
 
24. 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley. Consultant represents that its management and storage of Cornell Data 
shall in all respects, including, without limitation, administrative, physical and technical aspects, meet the
