Exhibit “B” 
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH NONDISCRIMINATION REQUIREMENT 
 
The Olympia City Council has made compliance with the City’s Nondiscrimination in Delivery of City Services 
or Resources ordinance (OMC 1.24) a high priority, whether services are provided by City employees or 
through contract with other entities.  It is important that all contract agencies or vendors and their 
employees understand and carry out the City’s nondiscrimination policy.  Accordingly, each City agreement 
or contract for services contains language that requires an agency or vendor to agree that it shall not 
unlawfully discriminate against an employee or client based on any legally protected status, which includes 
but is not limited to:  race, creed, religion, color, national origin, age, sex, marital status, veteran status, 
sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, or the presence of any disability.  Unlawful 
discrimination includes transphobic discrimination or harassment, including transgender exclusion policies or 
practices in health benefits. 
 
Listed below are methods to ensure that this policy is communicated to your employees, if applicable.
