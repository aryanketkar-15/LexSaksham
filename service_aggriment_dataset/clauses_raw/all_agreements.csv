emp_006.pdf,C:\Users\aryan\LexShaksham\Lexsham_2.0_AfterChetan\lexsaksham\service_aggriment_dataset\clauses_raw\emp_006.txt,"HMS Consulting Tool Kit rev. Jan 2016

CONSULTING AGREEMENT KIT 
 
Consulting arrangement raise many of the same issues as other industry agreements (e.g. 
sponsored research, material transfer and confidentiality agreements).  In addition, you 
need to ensure such arrangements do not violate conflict of interest rules. Consulting 
arrangements may also raise personal issues requiring the attention of your own attorney 
(such as tax and stock ownership issues).    
 
This ""Kit"" is not legal advice or a substitute for legal advice from your attorney.  But it is 
intended to alert you to pertinent issues so you can look carefully at consulting 
documents that companies offer you.   Generally, consulting agreements are very 
negotiable; companies are eager to enter into consulting agreements with you because of 
your expertise and reputation.   Accepting a company template without discussion or 
additional review may be problematic.   
 
A chart, starting on page 3, compares the provisions typically seen in a first draft 
consulting agreement with those you should negotiate.   As you will see, many terms 
need to be addressed.  For example, HMS insurance generally does not protect you if you 
are sued for services under or related to a consulting agreement.  
 
Furthermore, since consulting is a private activity, you will not be considered a Harvard 
employee when providing consulting services, and Harvard will not indemnify you or 
provide you any legal defense if you are sued and/or found liable as a result of your 
consulting activities.  
 
Simple issues like travel reimbursement may need to be addressed as well.    
 
The Office of Academic and Research Integrity is pleased to be able to offer the 
HMS community several resources, including agreement review and the use of 
templates.  Please contact us at: consulting@hms.harvard.edu or (617) 432-3884. 
 
While the chart summarizes many issues, ""conflicts"" deserve special attention.   There are 
generally three ways your consulting agreement may conflict with your academic, 
clinical and research appointments: 
 
First, certain consulting agreement provisions are likely to place you in a position where 
you cannot meet academic obligations without breaching your consulting agreement.   
For example, if you agree to broad ""noncompete"" provisions, or if you consult in a broad 
""field"" overlapping your academic work and assign all inventions and data to the 
company, this will constrain your academic research, and may place you in violation of 
federal regulations and NIH policy concerning public availability of scientific 
discoveries.    If you substantially use any HMS resources in doing such consulting and 
assign the invention to the company, you will likely be in violation of the Harvard 
University Statement of Policy in Regard to Inventions, Patents and Copyrights , and you 
may have placed yourself in the middle of a potential lawsuit between the company and 
Harvard.    

HMS Consulting Tool Kit rev. Jan 2016 
Page 2 
 
Second, if your agreement violates the conflict of interest policies and regulations of 
Harvard Medical School, HHMI, NIH, or other sponsors, you may endanger your 
academic appointment and funding.  Furthermore, you may incur direct government 
penalties.    
 
For example, the Harvard Medical School Conflict of Interest Policy generally limits 
receipt of research funding from companies depending on the form and amount of 
compensation.   The Policy also requires advance review of arrangements which shift 
research from the academic to the corporate environment, and certain board and other 
positions.   
 
The NIH requires you to report, and HMS to reduce, manage or eliminate, any conflict of 
interest.   A ""conflict"" exists if you have any financial relationship or interest, above a 
certain threshold, in any entity which may be affected (positively or negatively) by your 
NIH-funded research.   If you consult for a company in your area of NIH-funded 
research, and are compensated in securities or above the thresholds, it is quite likely you 
will have a conflict of interest to report to the HMS Office for Academic and Research 
Integrity. You are encouraged to discuss whether a conflict exists with the HMS Dean for 
Faculty and Research Integrity or the Executive Director of Research Integrity and 
Compliance before signing a consulting agreement. 
 
Third, even if your arrangement appears acceptable, it may conflict in practice with civil 
and criminal laws.   For example, if you are a clinician who is paid above market or fair 
value for consulting services to a pharmaceutical company, the arrangement can subject 
you to criminal prosecution and civil penalties if the government believes there is a link 
between the payments and your referral and prescribing practices.    Actions you take 
with unregistered stock may conflict with various federal and state laws limiting the 
liquidity of such stock.   Similarly, trading stock, when you have ""inside"" knowledge 
because of the consulting arrangement, may subject you to criminal and civil penalties for 
insider trading.   These violations may also violate Harvard policy.  Therefore, you 
should ensure that the compensation you receive is reasonable (e.g. not excessive or 
clearly above market), and you should consult with your own attorney carefully before 
you exercise any rights or options involving securities you receive as compensation. 
 
The chart below contrasts typical company consulting agreement provisions against those 
in Harvard’s model agreement. Remember that this is for guidance purposes only, and 
that your own attorney should examine the impact of any agreement on you based on its 
specific terms and your personal objectives.   You are welcome to send questions and a 
draft of the agreement to the Office of Academic and Research Integrity for discussion 
and review, recognizing that it can not address personal issues for you.

GCC FOR SERVICES. January, 2018
PREAMBLE

In recent years, Indian Railways has seen a rise in the number of service
‘contracts in non-operational areas such as cleaning, facilties management,
consultancy etc. which continue to be governed by the General Conditions of
Contract (GCC) for Works at present

Given the diverse nature of works and services contracts and the problems
‘in managing service contracts using a GCC developed for works, a need was felt
to formulate a simplified, outcome focused GCC catering specifically to services to
improve contract management, delivery of services and to reduce goverment
ligation,

In this regard, a committee of Executive Directors/Railway Board was

formed with a mandate for ‘simplification and improvement of service contracts
with a view to improve the quality of services and service contract management”

The new GCC is a result of wide ranging consultations, profound erudition
and of immensely valuable contributions from all the directorates which examined
its provisions and connotations thereof, both evident and implicit

The recommendations of the committee after approval of the Civil
Engineering, Transformation, and Legal directorates, concurrence of Finance and
‘approval ofthe Railway Board are presented inthe form of the new document titled
8 “The General Conditions of Contract for Services”

Amit Garg,

Convener of the Committee on GCC for Services,
‘and

Executive Director! EnHMICE,

GENERAL CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT 
CONTRACTS FOR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES 
CONTRACTS FOR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES 
REV.: APR 2012 
1. LEGAL STATUS OF THE PARTIES: The United Nations and the Contractor shall also each be referred to as a 
“Party” hereunder, and: 
1.1 Pursuant, inter alia, to the Charter of the United Nations and the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities 
of the United Nations, the United Nations, including its subsidiary organs, has full juridical personality and 
enjoys such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent fulfillment of its purposes. 
1.2 The Contractor shall have the legal status of an independent contractor vis-à-vis the United Nations, and nothing 
contained in or relating to the Contract shall be construed as establishing or creating between the Parties the 
relationship of employer and employee or of principal and agent.  The officials, representatives, employees, or 
subcontractors of each of the Parties shall not be considered in any respect as being the employees or agents of 
the other Party, and each Party shall be solely responsible for all claims arising out of or relating to its 
engagement of such persons or entities. 
2. RESPONSIBILITY FOR EMPLOYEES:  To the extent that the Contract involves the provision of any services to the 
United Nations by the Contractor’s officials, employees, agents, servants, subcontractors and other representatives 
(collectively, the Contractor’s “personnel”), the following provisions shall apply: 
2.1 The Contractor shall be responsible for the professional and technical competence of the personnel it assigns to 
perform work under the Contract and will select reliable and competent individuals who will be able to 
effectively perform the obligations under the Contract and who, while doing so, will respect the local laws and 
customs and conform to a high standard of moral and ethical conduct. 
2.2 Such Contractor personnel shall be professionally qualified and, if required to work with officials or staff of the 
United Nations, shall be able to do so effectively.  The qualifications of any personnel whom the Contractor 
may assign or may propose to assign to perform any obligations under the Contract shall be substantially the 
same, or better, as the qualifications of any personnel originally proposed by the Contractor. 
2.3 At the option of and in the sole discretion of the United Nations: 
2.3.1 the qualifications of personnel proposed by the Contractor (e.g., a curriculum vitae)  may be 
reviewed by the United Nations prior to such personnel’s performing any obligations under the 
Contract; 
2.3.2 any personnel proposed by the Contractor to perform obligations under the Contract may be 
interviewed by qualified staff or officials of the United Nations prior to such personnel’s performing 
any obligations under the Contract; and, 
2.3.3 in cases in which, pursuant to Article 2.3.1 or 2.3.2, above, the United Nations has reviewed the 
qualifications of such Contractor’s personnel, the United Nations may reasonably refuse to accept 
any such personnel. 
2.4 Requirements specified in the Contract regarding the number or qualifications of the Contractor’s personnel 
may change during the course of performance of the Contract.  Any such change shall be made only following 
written notice of such proposed change and upon written agreement between the Parties regarding such change, 
subject to the following: 
2.4.1 The United Nations may, at any time, request, in writing, the withdrawal or replacement of any of the 
Contractor’s personnel, and such request shall not be unreasonably refused by the Contractor. 
2.4.2 Any of the Contractor’s personnel assigned to perform obligations under the Contract shall not be 
withdrawn or replaced without the prior written consent of the United Nations, which shall not be 
unreasonably withheld.

GENERAL CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT FOR CONTRACTS FOR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES 
PAGE 2 
2.4.3 The withdrawal or replacement of the Contractor’s personnel shall be carried out as quickly as 
possible and in a manner that will not adversely affect the performance of obligations under the 
Contract. 
2.4.4 All expenses related to the withdrawal or replacement of the Contractor’s personnel shall, in all 
cases, be borne exclusively by the Contractor. 
2.4.5 Any request by the United Nations for the withdrawal or replacement of the Contractor’s personnel 
shall not be considered to be a termination, in whole or in part, of the Contract, and the United 
Nations shall not bear any liability in respect of such withdrawn or replaced personnel. 
2.4.6 If a request for the withdrawal or replacement of the Contractor’s personnel is not based upon a 
default by or failure on the part of the Contractor to perform its obligations in accordance with the 
Contract, the misconduct of the personnel, or the inability of such personnel to reasonably work 
together with United Nations officials and staff, then the Contractor shall not be liable by reason of 
any such request for the withdrawal or replacement of the Contractor’s personnel for any delay in the 
performance by the Contractor of its obligations under the Contract that is substantially the result of 
such personnel’s being withdrawn or replaced. 
2.5 Nothing in Articles 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4, above, shall be construed to create any obligations on the part of the United 
Nations with respect to the Contractor’s personnel assigned to perform work under the Contract, and such 
personnel shall remain the sole responsibility of the Contractor. 
2.6 The Contractor shall be responsible for requiring that all personnel assigned by it to perform any obligations 
under the Contract and who may have access to any premises or other property of the United Nations shall: 
2.6.1 undergo or comply with security screening requirements made known to the Contractor by the 
United Nations, including but not limited to, a review of any criminal history;  
2.6.2 when within United Nations premises or on United Nations property, display such identification as 
may be approved and furnished by the United Nations security officials, and that upon the 
withdrawal or replacement of any such personnel or upon termination or completion of the Contract, 
such personnel shall immediately return any such identification to the United Nations for 
cancellation. 
2.7 Within one working day after learning that any of Contractor’s personnel who have access to any United 
Nations premises have been charged by law enforcement authorities with an offense other than a minor traffic 
offense, the Contractor shall provide written notice to inform the United Nations about the particulars of the 
charges then known and shall continue to inform the United Nations concerning all substantial developments 
regarding the disposition of such charges.  
2.8 All operations of the Contractor, including without limitation, storage of equipment, materials, supplies and 
parts, within United Nations premises or on United Nations property shall be confined to areas authorized or 
approved by the United Nations.  The Contractor’s personnel shall not enter or pass through and shall not store 
or dispose of any of its equipment or materials in any areas within United Nations premises or on United 
Nations property without appropriate authorization from the United Nations. 
3. ASSIGNMENT: 
3.1 Except as provided in Article 3.2, below, the Contractor may not assign, transfer, pledge or make any other 
disposition of the Contract, of any part of the Contract, or of any of the rights, claims or obligations under the 
Contract except with the prior written authorization of the UN.  Any such unauthorized assignment, transfer, 
pledge or other disposition, or any attempt to do so, shall not be binding on the United Nations.  Except as 
permitted with respect to any approved subcontractors, the Contractor shall not delegate any of its obligations 
under this Contract, except with the prior written consent of the UN.  Any such unauthorized delegation, or 
attempt to do so, shall not be binding on the United Nations. 
3.2 The Contractor may assign or otherwise transfer the Contract to the surviving entity resulting from a 
reorganization of the Contractor’s operations, provided that: 
3.2.1 such reorganization is not the result of any bankruptcy, receivership or other similar proceedings; 
and,

3.2.2 such reorganization arises from a sale, merger, or acquisition of all or substantially all of the 
Contractor’s assets or ownership interests; and, 
3.2.3 the Contractor promptly notifies the United Nations about such assignment or transfer at the earliest 
opportunity; and, 
3.2.4 the assignee or transferee agrees in writing to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the 
Contract, and such writing is promptly provided to the United Nations following the assignment or 
transfer. 
4. SUBCONTRACTING:  In the event that the Contractor requires the services of subcontractors to perform any 
obligations under the Contract, the Contractor shall obtain the prior written approval of the United Nations.  The United 
Nations shall be entitled, in its sole discretion, to review the qualifications of any subcontractors and to reject any 
proposed subcontractor that the United Nations reasonably considers is not qualified to perform obligations under the 
Contract.  The United Nations shall have the right to require any subcontractor’s removal from United Nations premises 
without having to give any justification therefor.  Any such rejection or request for removal shall not, in and of itself, 
entitle the Contractor to claim any delays in the performance, or to assert any excuses for the non-performance, of any of 
its obligations under the Contract, and the Contractor shall be solely responsible for all services and obligations 
performed by its subcontractors.  The terms of any subcontract shall be subject to, and shall be construed in a manner 
that is fully in accordance with, all of the terms and conditions of the Contract. 
5. INDEMNIFICATION: 
5.1 The Contractor shall indemnify, defend, and hold and save harmless, the United Nations, and its officials, 
agents and employees, from and against all suits, proceedings, claims, demands, losses and liability of any kind 
or nature brought by any third party against the United Nations, including, but not limited to, all litigation costs 
and expenses, attorney’s fees, settlement payments and damages, based on, arising from, or relating to: 
5.1.1 allegations or claims that the possession of or use by the United Nations of any patented device, any 
copyrighted material, or any other goods, property or services provided or licensed to the United 
Nations under the terms of the Contract, in whole or in part, separately or in a combination 
contemplated by the Contractor’s published specifications therefor, or otherwise specifically 
approved by the Contractor, constitutes an infringement of any patent, copyright, trademark, or other 
intellectual property right of any third party; or, 
5.1.2 any acts or omissions of the Contractor, or of any subcontractor or anyone directly or indirectly 
employed by them in the performance of the Contract, which give rise to legal liability to anyone not 
a party to the Contract, including, without limitation, claims and liability in the nature of a claim for 
workers’ compensation. 
5.2 The indemnity set forth in Article 5.1.1, above, shall not apply to: 
5.2.1 A claim of infringement resulting from the Contractor’s compliance with specific written instructions 
by the United Nations directing a change in the specifications for the goods, property, materials, 
equipment or supplies to be or used, or directing a manner of performance of the Contract or 
requiring the use of specifications not normally used by the Contractor; or 
5.2.2 A claim of infringement resulting from additions to or changes in any goods, property, materials 
equipment, supplies or any components thereof furnished under the Contract if the United Nations or 
another party acting under the direction of the United Nations made such changes. 
5.3 In addition to the indemnity obligations set forth in this Article 5, the Contractor shall be obligated, at its sole 
expense, to defend the United Nations and its officials, agents and employees, pursuant to this Article 5, 
regardless of whether the suits, proceedings, claims and demands in question actually give rise to or otherwise 
result in any loss or liability. 
5.4 The United Nations shall advise the Contractor about any such suits, proceedings, claims, demands, losses or 
liability within a reasonable period of time after having received actual notice thereof.  The Contractor shall 
have sole control of the defense of any such suit, proceeding, claim or demand and of all negotiations in 
connection with the settlement or compromise thereof, except with respect to the assertion or defense of the 
privileges and immunities of the United Nations or any matter relating thereto, for which only the United

Nations itself is authorized to assert and maintain.  The United Nations shall have the right, at its own expense, 
to be represented in any such suit, proceeding, claim or demand by independent counsel of its own choosing. 
5.5 In the event the use by the United Nations of any goods, property or services provided or licensed to the United 
Nations by the Contractor, in whole or in part, in any suit or proceeding, is for any reason enjoined, temporarily 
or permanently, or is found to infringe any patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property right, or in 
the event of a settlement, is enjoined, limited or otherwise interfered with, then the Contractor, at its sole cost 
and expense, shall, promptly, either: 
5.5.1 procure for the United Nations the unrestricted right to continue using such goods or services 
provided to the United Nations; 
5.5.2 replace or modify the goods or services provided to the United Nations, or part thereof, with the 
equivalent or better goods or services, or part thereof, that is non-infringing; or,

6.2 Unless otherwise provided in the Contract, prior to commencement of performance of any other obligations 
under the Contract, and subject to any limits set forth in the Contract, the Contractor shall take out and shall 
maintain for the entire term of the Contract, for any extension thereof, and for a period following any 
termination of the Contract reasonably adequate to deal with losses: 
6.2.1 insurance against all risks in respect of its property and any equipment used for the performance of 
the Contract; 
6.2.2 workers’ compensation insurance, or its equivalent, or employer’s liability insurance, or its 
equivalent, with respect to the Contractor’s personnel sufficient to cover all claims for injury, death

relating to the Contract.

supplies that may be furnished by the United Nations to the Contractor for the performance of any obligations under the 
Contract shall rest with the United Nations, and any such equipment shall be returned to the United Nations at the 
conclusion of the Contract or when no longer needed by the Contractor.  Such equipment, when returned to the United 
Nations, shall be in the same condition as when delivered to the Contractor, subject to normal wear and tear, and the 
Contractor shall be liable to compensate the United Nations for the actual costs of any loss of, damage to, or degradation 
of the equipment that is beyond normal wear and tear. 
9. COPYRIGHT, PATENTS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS: 
9.1  Except as is otherwise expressly provided in writing in the Contract, the United Nations shall be entitled to all

materials which the Contractor has developed for the United Nations under the Contract and which bear a 
direct relation to or are produced or prepared or collected in consequence of, or during the course of, the

obligations under the Contract, or (ii) that the Contractor may develop or acquire, or may have developed or 
acquired, independently of the performance of its obligations under the Contract, the United Nations does not 
and shall not claim any ownership interest thereto, and the Contractor grants to the United Nations a perpetual

any such disclosure is made. 
11.4 The United Nations may disclose Information to the extent as required pursuant to the Charter of the United 
Nations, or pursuant to resolutions or regulations of the General Assembly or rules promulgated thereunder.

12. FORCE MAJEURE; OTHER CHANGES IN CONDITIONS: 
12.1 In the event of and as soon as possible after the occurrence of any cause constituting force majeure, the 
affected Party shall give notice and full particulars in writing to the other Party, of such occurrence or cause if 
the affected Party is thereby rendered unable, wholly or in part, to perform its obligations and meet its 
responsibilities under the Contract.  The affected Party shall also notify the other Party of any other changes in 
condition or the occurrence of any event which interferes or threatens to interfere with its performance of the 
Contract.  Not more than fifteen (15) days following the provision of such notice of force majeure or other 
changes in condition or occurrence, the affected Party shall also submit a statement to the other Party of 
estimated expenditures that will likely be incurred for the duration of the change in condition or the event of 
force majeure.  On receipt of the notice or notices required hereunder, the Party not affected by the occurrence 
of a cause constituting force majeure shall take such action as it reasonably considers to be appropriate or 
necessary in the circumstances, including the granting to the affected Party of a reasonable extension of time 
in which to perform any obligations under the Contract. 
12.2 If the Contractor is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by reason of force majeure to perform its obligations 
and meet its responsibilities under the Contract, the United Nations shall have the right to suspend or terminate 
the Contract on the same terms and conditions as are provided for in Article 13, “Termination,” except that the 
period of notice shall be seven (7) days instead of thirty (30) days.  In any case, the United Nations shall be 
entitled to consider the Contractor permanently unable to perform its obligations under the Contract in case the 
Contractor is unable to perform its obligations, wholly or in part, by reason of force majeure for any period  in 
excess of ninety (90) days. 
12.3 Force majeure as used herein means any unforeseeable and irresistible act of nature, any act of war (whether 
declared or not), invasion, revolution, insurrection, terrorism, or any other acts of a similar nature or force, 
provided that such acts arise from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the 
Contractor.  The Contractor acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to any obligations under the Contract 
that the Contractor must perform in areas in which the United Nations is engaged in, preparing to engage in, or 
disengaging from any peacekeeping, humanitarian or similar operations, any delays or failure to perform such 
obligations arising from or relating to harsh conditions within such areas, or to any incidents of civil unrest 
occurring in such areas, shall not, in and of itself, constitute force majeure under the Contract. 
13. TERMINATION: 
13.1 Either Party may terminate the Contract for cause, in whole or in part, upon thirty (30) day’s notice, in writing, 
to the other Party.  The initiation of conciliation or arbitral proceedings in accordance with Article 16 
“Settlement of Disputes,” below, shall not be deemed to be a “cause” for or otherwise to be in itself a 
termination of the Contract. 
13.2 The United Nations may terminate the Contract at any time by providing written notice to the Contractor in 
any case in which the mandate of the United Nations applicable to the performance of the Contract or the 
funding of the United Nations applicable to the Contract is curtailed or terminated, whether in whole or in 
part.  In addition, unless otherwise provided by the Contract, upon sixty (60) day’s advance written notice to 
the Contractor, the United Nations may terminate the Contract without having to provide any justification 
therefor.   
13.3 In the event of any termination of the Contract, upon receipt of notice of termination that has been issued by 
the United Nations, the Contractor shall, except as may be directed by the United Nations in the notice of 
termination or otherwise in writing: 
13.3.1 
take immediate steps to bring the performance of any obligations under the Contract to a close in a 
prompt and orderly manner, and in doing so, reduce expenses to a minimum; 
13.3.2 
refrain from undertaking any further or additional commitments under the Contract as of and 
following the date of receipt of such notice; 
13.3.3 
place no further subcontracts or orders for materials, services, or facilities, except as the United 
Nations and the Contractor agree in writing are necessary to complete any portion of the Contract 
that is not terminated; 
13.3.4 
terminate all subcontracts or orders to the extent they relate to the portion of the Contract 
terminated;

process, completed work, supplies, and other material produced or acquired for the portion of the

tangible or intangible, related to the Contract that is in the possession of the Contractor and in 
which the United Nations has or may be reasonably expected to acquire an interest.  
13.4 In the event of any termination of the Contract, the United Nations shall be entitled to obtain reasonable 
written accountings from the Contractor concerning all obligations performed or pending in accordance with 
the Contract.  In addition, the United Nations shall not be liable to pay the Contractor except for those goods 
delivered and services provided to the United Nations in accordance with the requirements of the Contract, but 
only if such goods or services were ordered, requested or otherwise provided prior to the Contractor’s receipt 
of notice of termination from the United Nations or prior to the Contractor’s tendering of notice of termination 
to the United Nations. 
13.5 The United Nations may, without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to it, terminate the Contract 
forthwith in the event that: 
13.5.1 
the Contractor is adjudged bankrupt, or is liquidated, or becomes insolvent, or applies for a 
moratorium or stay on any payment or repayment obligations, or applies to be declared insolvent; 
13.5.2 
the Contractor is granted a moratorium or a stay, or is declared insolvent; 
13.5.3 
the Contractor makes an assignment for the benefit of one or more of its creditors; 
13.5.4 
 a Receiver is appointed on account of the insolvency of the Contractor; 
13.5.5

13.5.6 
the United Nations reasonably determines that the Contractor has become subject to a materially 
adverse change in its financial condition that threatens to substantially affect the ability of the 
Contractor to perform any of its obligations under the Contract. 
13.6 Except as prohibited by law, the Contractor shall be bound to compensate the United Nations for all damages 
and costs, including, but not limited to, all costs incurred by the United Nations in any legal or non-legal 
proceedings, as a result of any of the events specified in Article 13.5, above, and resulting from or relating to a 
termination of the Contract, even if the Contractor is adjudged bankrupt, or is granted a moratorium or stay or 
is declared insolvent.  The Contractor shall immediately inform the United Nations of the occurrence of any of 
the events specified in Article 13.5, above, and shall provide the United Nations with any information 
pertinent thereto. 
13.7 The provisions of this Article 13 are without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the United Nations 
under the Contract or otherwise. 
14. NON-WAIVER OF RIGHTS:  The failure by either Party to exercise any rights available to it, whether under the 
Contract or otherwise, shall not be deemed for any purposes to constitute a waiver by the other Party of any such right or 
any remedy associated therewith, and shall not relieve the Parties of any of their obligations under the Contract. 
15. NON-EXCLUSIVITY:  Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, the United Nations shall have no obligation to 
purchase any minimum quantities of goods or services from the Contractor, and the United Nations shall have no 
limitation on its right to obtain goods or services of the same kind, quality and quantity described in the Contract, from 
any other source at any time. 
16. SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES: 
16.1 AMICABLE SETTLEMENT:  The Parties shall use their best efforts to amicably settle any dispute,

Parties wish to seek such an amicable settlement through conciliation, the conciliation shall take place in 
accordance with the Conciliation Rules then obtaining of the United Nations Commission on International 
Trade Law (“UNCITRAL”), or according to such other procedure as may be agreed between the Parties in 
writing. 
16.2 ARBITRATION:  Any dispute, controversy, or claim between the Parties arising out of the Contract or the 
breach, termination, or invalidity thereof, unless settled amicably under Article 16.1, above, within sixty (60) 
days after receipt by one Party of the other Party’s written request for such amicable settlement, shall be 
referred by either Party to arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules then obtaining.  
The decisions of the arbitral tribunal shall be based on general principles of international commercial law.  
The arbitral tribunal shall be empowered to order the return or destruction of goods or any property, whether 
tangible or intangible, or of any confidential information provided under the Contract, order the termination of 
the Contract, or order that any other protective measures be taken with respect to the goods, services or any 
other property, whether tangible or intangible, or of any confidential information provided under the Contract, 
as appropriate, all in accordance with the authority of the arbitral tribunal pursuant to Article 26 (“Interim 
measures”) and Article 34 (“Form and effect of the award”) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.  The 
arbitral tribunal shall have no authority to award punitive damages.  In addition, unless otherwise expressly 
provided in the Contract, the arbitral tribunal shall have no authority to award interest in excess of the London 
Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) then prevailing, and any such interest shall be simple interest only.  The 
Parties shall be bound by any arbitration award rendered as a result of such arbitration as the final adjudication 
of any such dispute, controversy, or claim. 
17. PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES: Nothing in or relating to the Contract shall be deemed a waiver, express or 
implied, of any of the privileges and immunities of the United Nations, including its subsidiary organs. 
18. TAX EXEMPTION: 
18.1 Article II, Section 7, of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations provides, inter 
alia, that the United Nations, including its subsidiary organs, is exempt from all direct taxes, except charges 
for public utility services, and is exempt from customs restrictions, duties, and charges of a similar nature in 
respect of articles imported or exported for its official use.  In the event any governmental authority refuses to 
recognize the exemptions of the United Nations from such taxes, restrictions, duties, or charges, the Contractor 
shall immediately consult with the United Nations to determine a mutually acceptable procedure. 
18.2 The Contractor authorizes the United Nations to deduct from the Contractor’s invoices any amount 
representing such taxes, duties or charges, unless the Contractor has consulted with the United Nations before 
the payment thereof and the United Nations has, in each instance, specifically authorized the Contractor to pay 
such taxes, duties, or charges under written protest.  In that event, the Contractor shall provide the United 
Nations with written evidence that payment of such taxes, duties or charges has been made and appropriately 
authorized, and the United Nations shall reimburse the Contractor for any such taxes, duties, or charges so 
authorized by the United Nations and paid by the Contractor under written protest. 
19. MODIFICATIONS: 
19.1 Pursuant to the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, only the Chief of the United Nations 
Procurement Division, or such other Contracting authority as the United Nations has made known to the 
Contractor in writing, possesses the authority to agree on behalf of the United Nations to any modification of 
or change in the Contract, to a waiver of any of its provisions or to any additional contractual relationship of 
any kind with the Contractor.  Accordingly, no modification or change in the Contract shall be valid and 
enforceable against the United Nations unless provided by a valid written amendment to the Contract signed 
by the Contractor and the Chief of the United Nations Procurement Division or such other contracting 
authority. 
19.2 If the Contract shall be extended for additional periods in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
Contract, the terms and conditions applicable to any such extended term of the Contract shall be the same 
terms and conditions as set forth in the Contract, unless the Parties shall have agreed otherwise pursuant to a 
valid amendment concluded in accordance with Article 19.1, above.

19.3 The terms or conditions of any supplemental undertakings, licenses, or other forms of agreement concerning 
any goods or services provided under the Contract shall not be valid and enforceable against the United 
Nations nor in any way shall constitute an agreement by the United Nations thereto unless any such 
undertakings, licenses or other forms are the subject of a valid amendment concluded in accordance with 
Article 19.1, above. 
20. AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS: 
20.1 Each invoice paid by the United Nations shall be subject to a post-payment audit by auditors, whether internal 
or external, of the United Nations or by other authorized and qualified agents of the United Nations at any 
time during the term of the Contract and for a period of three (3) years following the expiration or prior 
termination of the Contract.  The United Nations shall be entitled to a refund from the Contractor for any 
amounts shown by such audits to have been paid by the United Nations other than in accordance with the 
terms and conditions of the Contract. 
20.2 The United Nations may conduct investigations relating to any aspect of the Contract or the award thereof, the 
obligations performed under the Contract, and the operations of the Contractor generally relating to 
performance of the Contract at any time during the term of the Contract and for a period of three (3) years 
following the expiration or prior termination of the Contract.  
20.3  The Contractor shall provide its full and timely cooperation with any such inspections, post-payment audits or 
investigations.  Such cooperation shall include, but shall not be limited to, the Contractor’s obligation to make 
available its personnel and any relevant documentation for such purposes at reasonable times and on 
reasonable conditions and to grant to the United Nations access to the Contractor’s premises at reasonable 
times and on reasonable conditions in connection with such access to the Contractor’s personnel and relevant 
documentation.  The Contractor shall require its agents, including, but not limited to, the Contractor’s 
attorneys, accountants or other advisers, to reasonably cooperate with any inspections, post-payment audits or 
investigations carried out by the United Nations hereunder. 
21. LIMITATION ON ACTIONS: 
21.1 Except with respect to any indemnification obligations in Article 5, above, or as are otherwise set forth in the 
Contract, any arbitral proceedings in accordance with Article 16.2, above, arising out of the Contract must be 
commenced within three years after the cause of action has accrued. 
21.2 The Parties further acknowledge and agree that, for these purposes, a cause of action shall accrue when the 
breach actually occurs, or, in the case of latent defects, when the injured Party knew or should have known all 
of the essential elements of the cause of action, or in the case of a breach of warranty, when tender of delivery 
is made, except that, if a warranty extends to future performance of the goods or any process or system and the 
discovery of the breach consequently must await the time when such goods or other process or system is ready 
to perform in accordance with the requirements of the Contract, the cause of action accrues when such time of 
future performance actually begins. 
22. ESSENTIAL TERMS: The Contractor acknowledges and agrees that each of the provisions in Articles 23 to 28 
hereof constitutes an essential term of the Contract and that any breach of any of these provisions shall entitle the 
United Nations to terminate the Contract or any other contract with the United Nations immediately upon notice to 
the Contractor, without any liability for termination charges or any other liability of any kind. 
23. SOURCE OF INSTRUCTIONS: The Contractor shall neither seek nor accept instructions from any authority external 
to the United Nations in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Contract.  Should any authority 
external to the United Nations seek to impose any instructions concerning or restrictions on the Contractor’s performance 
under the Contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the United Nations and provide all reasonable assistance 
required by the United Nations.  The Contractor shall not take any action in respect of the performance of its obligations 
under the Contract that may adversely affect the interests of the United Nations, and the Contractor shall perform its 
obligations under the Contract with the fullest regard to the interests of the United Nations. 
24. OFFICIALS NOT TO BENEFIT: The Contractor warrants that it has not and shall not offer to any representative, 
official, employee, or other agent of the United Nations any direct or indirect benefit arising from or related to the 
performance of the Contract or of any other contract with the United Nations or the award thereof or for any other 
purpose intended to gain an advantage for the Contractor.

all obligations relating to its registration as a qualified vendor of goods or services to the United Nations, as such 
obligations are set forth in the United Nations vendor registration procedures. 
26. CHILD LABOR:  The Contractor represents and warrants that neither it, its parent entities (if any), nor any of the 
Contractor’s subsidiary or affiliated entities (if any) is engaged in any practice inconsistent with the rights set forth in the

    28.1   The Contractor shall take all appropriate measures to prevent sexual exploitation or abuse of anyone by its 
employees or any other persons engaged and controlled by the Contractor to perform any services under the 
Contract.  For these purposes, sexual activity with any person less than eighteen years of age, regardless of 
any laws relating to consent, shall constitute the sexual exploitation and abuse of such person.  In addition, the 
Contractor shall refrain from, and shall take all reasonable and appropriate measures to prohibit its employees 
or other persons engaged and controlled by it from exchanging any money, goods, services, or other things of 
value, for sexual favors or activities, or from engaging any sexual activities that are exploitive or degrading to 
any person.   
     28.2   The United Nations shall not apply the foregoing standard relating to age in any case in which the Contractor’s 
personnel or any other person who may be engaged by the Contractor to perform any services under the 
Contract is married to the person less than the age of eighteen years with whom sexual activity has occurred 
and in which such marriage is recognized as valid under the laws of the country of citizenship of such 
Contractor’s personnel or such other person who may be engaged by the Contractor to perform any services 
under the Contract.

Industry Software Division Cloud Services Agreement 
BY (A) CLICKING ON AN “ACCEPT” BUTTON, OR (B) EXECUTING AN ORDER THAT 
REFERENCES THIS CLOUD SERVICES AGREEMENT, OR (C) OTHERWISE USING OR ACCESSING 
CLOUD SERVICES, YOU (“LICENSEE” or “CUSTOMER”) AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS CLOUD 
SERVICES AGREEMENT.  IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY 
OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL 
AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY TO THESE TERMS IN WHICH 
CASE THE TERM “CUSTOMER” WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY. THIS CLOUD SERVICES 
AGREEMENT IS EFFECTIVE AS OF THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND SHALL REMAIN 
IN FORCE UNTIL TERMINATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS HEREIN. 
 
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU 
SHOULD NOT ACCEPT THIS CLOUD SERVICES AGREEMENT OR USE OR ACCESS THE CLOUD 
SERVICES.  
This Cloud Services Agreement is by and between Customer and HCL Technologies Limited, a company 
duly organized and existing under the laws of India and having its registered offices at 806 Siddharth, 96 Nehru 
Place, New Delhi-110019 (“HCL”), and governs the receipt and use by Customer of cloud services provided 
by HCL and made available via a network (“Cloud Services”).  HCL and Customer are hereinafter referred to 
individually or collectively, as “Party” or “Parties.”  This Cloud Services Agreement (CSA) and applicable 
Attachments, Orders and Service Descriptions (SDs) are the complete agreement regarding transactions under 
this CSA (together, the ""Agreement"") under which Customer may order Cloud Services. A SD is a document 
that provides a description and other information regarding a specific Cloud Service. Attachments, SDs, and 
Support information are available at https://www.hcltech.com/ERX per product as applicable Attachments 
provide supplemental terms that apply to certain types of Cloud Services. An Order is an agreed written or 
electronic document, subject to the terms and conditions of this CSA that identifies the Cloud Services to be 
provided, quantity/usage limits of each Cloud Service to be provided, applicable fees, taxes, payment terms 
and the Support to be purchased, and any other applicable terms (including but not limited to a listing of any 
additional authorized users which for avoidance of doubt Customer shall be responsible for their agreement 
and compliance with the terms hereof).  
“Support” may mean basic Support, Premium Support or Extended Support. Customer is automatically 
enrolled in basic Support for the Cloud Service identified in an Order for the first 12 months thereof at no 
additional cost. HCL may offer and Customer may purchase basic Support for a renewal period, Premium 
Support or Extended Support, via the execution of a separate contract or Order. Any conflicting terms in an 
Attachment, Order or SD that override other parts of this CSA will be identified in the Attachment, Order or 
SD accepted by the Customer and only apply to the specific transaction. “Premium Support” is where HCL 
assigns a named HCL support engineer to provide proactive and responsive support to the Licensee, beyond 
the basic Support. It is in addition to the basic Support charges. “Extended Support” is where HCL offers basic 
Support for older versions of the Program. It is in addition to the basic Support charges. 
Cloud Services and Support are obtained solely in connection with Orders executed by both Parties. Each 
Order is subject to the term of this CSA and deemed to be a discrete contract, separate from each other Order, 
unless expressly stated otherwise therein. Orders may be entered into under this CSA by and between (a) HCL 
or an Affiliate of HCL; and (b) Customer or an Affiliate of Customer. With respect to an Order, the term HCL 
or Customer will be deemed to refer to the entities that execute such Order, but in all cases Customer is fully 
responsible for ensuring its Affiliates’ (and other authorized users’) agreement and compliance with the terms 
hereof (including any Order). Neither execution of this CSA nor anything contained herein will obligate either 
Party to enter into any Orders. In the event an Order is proposed by HCL, and is deemed to constitute an offer, 
then acceptance of such offer is limited to its terms. In the event Customer proposes or accepts an Order by 
submitting a Customer purchase order, order document, acknowledgment, or other Customer communication, 

 
 
Page 2 of 9 
then regardless of whether HCL acknowledges, accepts, fully or partially performs under any such document, 
HCL objects and rejects any additional or different term in such document and none of such additional or 
different terms will become part of the agreement between the Parties even if HCL uses or refers to such 
document for invoicing purpose. Solely for administrative convenience of the Parties in ordering hereunder, 
Customer may issue a purchase order in lieu of the Parties signing the HCL Order form (HCL Program License 
and Support Order Schedule) and such purchase order shall then be deemed an Order for ordering purposes. 
Such purchase order shall be subject to this CSA, and any different terms in such purchase order (whether 
payment terms, taxes, warranty, scope of Support, limitation of liability, termination, or otherwise) will not 
apply as the purpose of the purchase order is solely for identifying pricing, product/service selected, and 
quantity for ordering hereunder. All references in this Agreement to differing or additional terms that may 
apply in an Order do not apply to purchase orders used as the Order. Subject to this paragraph, HCL (or its 
Affiliates) may accept the purchase order by processing it. 
1. 
Cloud Services 
a. 
HCL Cloud Services are designed to be available 24/7, subject to maintenance. Customer will 
be notified of scheduled maintenance. Technical support and service level commitments for each 
Cloud Service, if applicable, are specified in an Attachment or SD or are available at  
https://www.hcltech.com/ERX per product as applicable.  
b. 
HCL may offer non-HCL services (“Non-HCL Services”), or an HCL Cloud Service may enable 
access to Non-HCL services, that may require acceptance of third party terms identified in the 
SD. Linking to or use of Non-HCL services constitutes Customer's agreement with such terms. 
HCL is not a party to such third party agreements and is not responsible for such Non-HCL 
services. HCL does not provide any warranties or support with respect to Non-HCL services. 
HCL may, at any time and at its sole discretion, discontinue Non-HCL service offerings or 
revoke access to Non-HCL services via HCL Cloud Service, without entitling Customer to any 
refund, credit, or other compensation and without incurring any liability under the Agreement. 
c. 
Customer accepts an Attachment or SD by ordering, enrolling, using, or making a payment for 
the Cloud Service. When HCL accepts Customer's order, HCL provides Customer the 
authorizations specified in the SD. 
d. 
HCL will provide the facilities, personnel, equipment, software, and other resources necessary 
to provide the Cloud Services and generally available user guides and documentation to support 
Customer's use of the Cloud Services. A Cloud Service may require the use of enabling software 
that Customer downloads to Customer systems to facilitate use of the Cloud Service. Customer 
may use enabling software only in connection with use of the Cloud Service and according to 
any licensing terms if specified in a SD. Enabling software is provided as-is, without warranties 
of any kind. 
e. 
Customer will provide hardware, software and connectivity to access and use the Cloud Service, 
including any required Customer-specific URL addresses and associated certificates. 
f. 
Customer may access a Cloud Service only to the extent of authorizations acquired by Customer. 
Customer is responsible for use of Cloud Services by any user who accesses the Cloud Service 
with Customer's account credentials. A Cloud Service may not be used in any jurisdiction for 
unlawful, obscene, offensive or fraudulent Content or activity, such as advocating or causing 
harm, interfering with or violating the integrity or security of a network or system, evading filters, 
sending unsolicited, abusive, or deceptive messages, viruses or harmful code, or violating third 
party rights. In addition, Customer may not use Cloud Services if failure of the Cloud Service 
could lead to death, bodily injury, or property or environmental damage. Customer shall not: i) 
reverse engineer any portion of a Cloud Service; ii) assign or resell direct access to a Cloud 
Service to a third party outside Customer's organization or use the Cloud Service for any reason 
other than Customer’s internal business purpose; or iii) combine Cloud Services with Customer's 

 
 
Page 3 of 9 
value add to create a commercially available Customer branded solution that Customer markets 
to its end user customers unless otherwise agreed in writing by HCL. 
g. 
Customer shall keep strictly confidential all materials and information provided by HCL. 
Customer may not copy or disclose any HCL intellectual property and/or information to any 
third party or use the same for any purpose other than for using the Cloud Services in accordance 
with the terms of the Agreement. 
h. 
A Cloud Service or feature of a Cloud Service is considered ""Preview"" when HCL makes such 
services or features available at no charge, with limited or pre-release functionality, or for a 
limited time to try available functionality (such as beta, trial, no-charge, or preview designated 
Cloud Services). Preview services are excluded from available service level agreements. A 
Preview service may not be covered by support and HCL may change or discontinue a Preview 
service at any time and without notice. HCL is not obligated to release a Preview service or make 
an equivalent service generally available.   
2. 
Content and Data Protection 
a. 
“Content” consists of all data, software, and information that Customer (or its authorized users) 
provides, authorizes access to, or inputs to the Cloud Service. Use of the Cloud Service will not 
affect Customer's ownership or license rights in such Content. HCL, its Affiliates, and 
contractors of either, may access and use the Content solely for the purpose of providing and 
managing the Cloud Service. HCL will treat all Content as confidential by not disclosing Content 
except to HCL employees and contractors and only to the extent necessary to deliver the Cloud 
Service, except for any Content that: (i) is or becomes generally known to the public, through no 
wrongful act of HCL; (ii) was known to HCL prior to its disclosure; (iii) is lawfully received 
from a third party; or (iv) was independently developed by HCL. Furthermore, HCL may disclose 
Content to the extent compelled by law to do so, provided HCL gives the Customer prior notice 
of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the 
Customer’s cost and expense, if the Customer wishes to contest the disclosure. 
b. 
Customer is responsible for obtaining all necessary rights and permissions to enable, and grants 
such rights and permissions to, HCL, its Affiliates, and contractors of either, to use, provide, 
store and otherwise process Content in the Cloud Service. This includes Customer making 
necessary disclosures and obtaining consent, if required, before providing individuals' 
information, including personal or other regulated data in such Content. If any Content could be 
subject to governmental regulation or may require security measures beyond those specified by 
HCL for a Cloud Service, Customer will not input, provide, or allow such Content unless 
specifically permitted in the terms of the relevant SD or unless HCL has otherwise first agreed 
in writing to implement additional security and other measures. 
c. 
HCL's Privacy Policy, available upon request, applies for generally available Cloud Service 
offerings. Specific security features and functions of a Cloud Service may be provided in an 
Attachment and SDs. Customer is responsible to assess the suitability of each Cloud Service for 
Customer's intended use and Content and to take necessary actions to order, enable, or use 
available data protection features appropriate for the Content being used with a Cloud Service. 
By using the Cloud Service, Customer accepts responsibility for use of the Cloud Services, and 
acknowledges that it meets Customer's requirements and processing instructions to enable 
compliance with applicable laws. 
d. 
HCL's Data Processing Terms (DPA) and applicable DPA Exhibit(s), available upon request, 
apply and prevail over any conflicting terms of the Agreement, if and to the extent the European 
General Data Protection Regulation (EU/2016/679) (GDPR) applies to personal data contained 
in Content. 
e. 
HCL will return or remove Content from HCL computing resources upon the expiration or 
cancellation of the Cloud Service, or earlier upon Customer's request. HCL may charge for 

 
 
Page 4 of 9 
certain activities performed at Customer's request (such as delivering Content in a specific 
format). HCL does not archive Content, however some Content may remain in Cloud Service 
backup files until expiration of such files as governed by HCL's backup retention practices. 
f. 
Upon request by either Party, HCL, Customer or Affiliates of either, will enter into additional 
agreements as required by law in the prescribed form for the protection of regulated personal 
data included in Content. The Parties agree (and will ensure that their respective Affiliates agree) 
that such additional agreements will be subject to the terms of the Agreement. 
3. 
Changes 
a. 
Customer acknowledges that HCL may modify: i) a Cloud Service; and ii) the Privacy 
Policy/DPA, from time to time at HCL's sole discretion and such modifications will replace prior 
versions as of the effective date. Updates to a SD will take effect upon a new order or for SDs 
previously agreed by the Customer will take effect upon the change effective date for ongoing 
services, or upon the renewal date for Cloud Services that automatically renew. The intent of any 
modification will be to: i) improve or clarify existing commitments; ii) maintain alignment to 
current adopted standards and applicable laws; or iii) provide additional features and 
functionality. Modifications will not materially degrade the security or data protection features 
or functionality of a Cloud Service. 
b. 
HCL may withdraw a Cloud Service on 12 months' notice and in such instance HCL will continue 
to provide the Cloud Service for the remainder of Customer's unexpired term in case of a fixed 
term and for all other cases work with Customer to migrate to another HCL offering. Access to 
Non-HCL services may be withdrawn by HCL at any time. 
c. 
Since this CSA may apply to many future Orders, HCL may modify this CSA by providing 
Customer at least three months' written notice. Changes are not retroactive; they apply, as of the 
effective date, only to new Orders, ongoing Orders that do not expire, and renewals. For 
transactions with a defined renewable contract period stated in an Order, Customer may request 
that HCL defer the change effective date until the end of the current contract period. Customer 
accepts changes by placing new Orders or continuing use after the change effective date or 
allowing transactions to renew after receipt of the change notice. Except as provided above, all 
changes to the Agreement must be in writing accepted by both Parties. 
4. 
Trial, Beta Cloud Services and Other Preview Services 
a. 
If Customer chooses to use any trial Cloud Services (“Trial Cloud Services”), beta Cloud 
Services (“Beta Cloud Services”), or any other Preview Services, Customer may do so only to 
evaluate functionality, performance, compatibility and reliability during the period that HCL 
specifies. In connection with such use, Customer specifically agrees that: 
 (i) 
Trial Cloud Services, Beta Cloud Services and other Preview Services are provided 
“AS-IS” and without support;  
 (ii) 
Any security, compliance, service level, and privacy commitments stated in this 
Agreement are not applicable to Trial Cloud Services, Beta Cloud Services or other Preview 
Services;   
 (iii) 
HCL may change or discontinue Trial Cloud Services, Beta Cloud Services or other 
Preview Services at any time and makes no commitment to make them generally available;   
 (iv) 
Beta Cloud Services are Confidential Information of HCL;  
 (v) 
Beta Cloud Services are experimental, provided for testing purposes only, and may 
not be used in production; and  
 (vi) 
Customer will comply with testing guidelines that HCL provides and will make 
reasonable efforts to provide feedback.  HCL shall own all such feedback and shall have the 

 
 
Page 5 of 9 
right, on a perpetual and irrevocable basis, to use such feedback for any reason without payment 
or other obligation to Customer. 
5. 
Warranties 
a. 
HCL warrants that it provides Cloud Services using commercially reasonable care and skill. The 
warranty for a Cloud Service ends when the Cloud Service ends. 
b. 
HCL does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of a Cloud Service or that HCL will 
correct all defects or prevent third party disruptions or unauthorized third-party access.  
c. 
The warranties stated in this Section are the exclusive warranties from HCL and replace all other 
warranties, including the implied warranties or conditions of satisfactory quality, 
merchantability, non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose. HCL warranties will not 
apply if there has been misuse, modification, damage not caused by HCL, or failure to comply 
with instructions provided by HCL. Preview services and Non-HCL services are made available 
under the Agreement as-is, without warranties of any kind. Third parties may provide their own 
warranties to Customer. 
6. 
Payment.  
6,1. 
Fees.  Customer will pay any and all fees as detailed in the Order. Except as provided therein, 
all amounts in the Order are in United States Dollars (USD). Payment is due in advance. Customer 
will pay HCL for the amounts due, owing, and duly invoiced under the Order within thirty (30) days 
of the date of invoice. Customer shall make all payments pursuant to the Order through electronic 
transfer of funds to the designated bank accounts as nominated by HCL in writing. Overdue amounts 
payable under the Order will bear interest from the original due date at the rate of one percent (1%) 
per month or the maximum legal rate, whichever is less. Except as provided in this CSA, all fees are 
non-refundable and non-cancelable. 
6.2 
Taxes.  All fees quoted are exclusive of taxes. Customer is responsible for payment of any 
sales, use, value added, GST, and any other similar taxes or governmental fees associated with the 
Order, except for taxes based on HCL’s net income, gross revenue or employment obligations. If HCL 
is obligated by applicable law to collect and remit any taxes or fees, the appropriate tax or fee amount 
will be charged and set forth in the applicable invoice. Customer agrees to bear any withholding tax 
liability as may be required by law and would increase payment due under the Order by such an amount 
so that the net payment made to HCL after deduction of applicable withholding tax is the same, had 
there been no withholding tax applicable. Customer is solely responsible for timely and accurate 
payment of applicable taxes and fees, irrespective of what HCL’s invoice may state. 
7. 
Liability and Indemnity 
a. 
HCL's entire cumulative liability for all claims (regardless of nature) related to the Agreement 
will not exceed the amount of any actual direct damages incurred by Customer up to the amounts 
paid hereunder by Customer to HCL, under the applicable Order, during the preceding twelve 
(12) month period for the affected service. HCL will not be liable for special, incidental, 
exemplary, indirect, or economic consequential damages, lost profits, business, value, revenue, 
goodwill, or anticipated savings, business interruption or loss/corruption of data. These 
limitations apply collectively to HCL, its Affiliates, contractors, and suppliers, and Customer 
shall ensure that its users agree to same.  
b. 
Damages that cannot be limited under applicable law are not subject to the above cap. 
c. 
If an unaffiliated third party asserts a claim against Customer that a Cloud Service acquired under 
the Agreement infringes a patent or copyright, HCL will at it election settle such claim or defend 
Customer against that claim and pay amounts finally awarded by a court against Customer or 
included in a settlement approved by HCL, provided that Customer promptly: i) notifies HCL in 

 
 
Page 6 of 9 
writing of the claim; ii) supplies information requested by HCL; and iii) allows HCL to control, 
and reasonably cooperates in, the defense and settlement, including mitigation efforts.  
d. 
HCL has no responsibility for claims based on Non-HCL products and services, items not 
provided by HCL, any violation of law or third-party rights caused by Customer's Content, 
materials, designs, or specifications, or for any act or omission of Customer or its representatives, 
or of any non-HCL person or entity, including but not limited to: (i) modification of the Cloud 
Service by a party other than HCL; (ii) use of the Cloud Service in combination with hardware, 
software or cloud infrastructure not provided by HCL; (iii) any unauthorized use of the Cloud 
Service; or (iv) Customer’s failure to incorporate updates or upgrades that would have avoided 
the alleged infringement. 
8. 
Term and Termination 
a. 
The Cloud Service period (“Subscription Period”) and Support period (“Support Period”) are 
set forth in the applicable Order. Following the initial term thereof, the Subscription Period and 
Support Period shall renew automatically for successive twelve (12) month terms each, subject 
to the right of either Party to cancel such renewal by delivery of written notice of non-renewal 
to the other Party at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the then current term.  
b. 
HCL may suspend or limit, to the extent necessary, Customer's use of a Cloud Service if HCL 
determines there is a material breach of Customer's obligations, a security breach, violation of 
law, or breach of the terms set forth in section 1(f). If the cause of the suspension can reasonably 
be remedied, HCL will provide notice of the actions Customer must take to reinstate the Cloud 
Service. If Customer fails to take such actions within a reasonable time, HCL may terminate the 
Cloud Service. Failure to pay HCL (or as applicable, HCL’s Business Partner) is a material 
breach. 
c. 
HCL may terminate or suspend the Agreement and/or any Cloud Service or Support upon written 
notice to Customer if Customer fails to meet the credit requirements established by HCL and 
does not cure same within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice from HCL (to the extent 
Customer consent for credit checks is necessary, Customer hereby provides its irrevocable 
consent for same during the term hereof), or if Customer: (i) files or has filed against it a petition 
in bankruptcy, (ii) has a receiver appointed to handle its assets or affairs, or (iii) makes or 
attempts to make an assignment for benefit of creditors. For purposes of this subsection (c), 
written notice can include email notice. For avoidance of doubt, (i) HCL’s right to terminate or 
suspend under this Agreement includes, but is not limited to, remotely deactivating license keys 
or shutting off Support; and (ii) HCL’s rights to terminate or suspend are in addition to other 
rights HCL may have. 
d. 
Either Party may terminate the Agreement: i) without cause on at least one month's notice to the 
other after expiration or termination of its obligations under the Agreement; or ii) immediately 
for cause, but terminate only with respect to the Cloud Service or Support at issue, if the other is 
in material breach of the Agreement, provided the one who is not complying is given written 
notice and 30 days to comply (it being acknowledged that HCL may provide notice by email).  
e. 
Customer may terminate a Cloud Service on one month's notice: i) at the written 
recommendation of a government or regulatory agency following a change in either applicable 
law or the Cloud Services; ii) if HCL's modification to the computing environment used to 
provide the Cloud Service causes Customer to be noncompliant with applicable laws; or iii) if 
HCL notifies Customer of a modification that has a material adverse effect on Customer's use of 
the Cloud Service, provided that HCL will have 90 days to work with Customer to minimize 
such effect. In the event of such termination, HCL shall refund a portion of any prepaid amounts 
for the applicable Cloud Service for the period after the date of termination. 
f. 
Effect of Termination and/or Expiration 

 
 
Page 7 of 9 
(1) 
Termination of the Agreement does not terminate existing Orders, and provisions of the 
Agreement as they relate to such Orders remain in effect until fulfilled or otherwise 
terminated in accordance with their terms, unless the Agreement has been terminated for 
cause or in accordance with Section 8(c). 
(2) 
If the Agreement is terminated for cause or in accordance with Section 8(c), Customer shall 
pay to HCL, on the date of termination, the total amounts due per the Agreement (and, 
unless Customer terminated for cause, Customer shall pay all fees that would have been 
paid had Agreement not terminated). If the Agreement is terminated for any other reason 
and if any Orders are in force after such termination, then the Customer shall make the 
payments in accordance with the applicable Order terms and the Agreement. 
(3) 
Upon termination or expiration of a Cloud Service, Customer shall pay to HCL, on the date 
of termination or expiration, the total amounts due for the applicable Cloud Service, and 
unless Customer terminated for cause, Customer shall pay all fees that would have been 
paid had the Cloud Service not terminated. 
(4) 
Upon termination of the Agreement or upon the termination or expiration of a Cloud 
Service, HCL may assist Customer in transitioning Customer’s Content to an alternative 
technology for an additional charge and under separately agreed terms. 
(5) 
Any terms that by their nature extend beyond the Agreement termination remain in effect 
until fulfilled, and apply to successors and assignees. 
9.

end uses or end users. 
b. 
For purchases in the U.S., any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement will be governed 
by the internal substantive laws of the State of California or federal courts located in California, 
without reference to (i) any conflicts of law principle that would apply the substantive laws of

Agreement and (ii) waives any right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to 
this Agreement.  For purchasing outside the U.S., both parties agree to the application of the laws 
of the country in which Customer obtained the Cloud Services to govern, interpret, and enforce 
all of Customer’s and HCL's respective rights, duties, and obligations arising from, or relating in 
any manner to, the subject matter of this Agreement, without reference to (i) any conflicts of law 
principle that would apply the substantive laws of another jurisdiction to the Parties' rights or 
duties; (ii) the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods; 
or (iii) other international laws. Furthermore, all rights, duties, and obligations arising from, or 
relating in any manner to, the subject matter of this Agreement, are subject to the jurisdiction of 
the courts of the country in which Customer obtained the Cloud Service.  
c. 
Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the rights and obligations of the Customer are valid only 
in the country of Customer's business address or the locations identified in the applicable Order. 
If Customer or any user exports or imports Content or use of any portion of the Cloud Service 
outside the country of Customer's business address or the location identified in the applicable 
Order, HCL will not serve as the exporter or importer. If any provision of the Agreement is 

 
 
Page 8 of 9 
invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect. Nothing in the 
Agreement affects statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract.  
10. 
General 
a. 
Customer agrees that HCL may, no more than one time per twelve (12) month period, audit the 
Cloud Services and Support usage hereunder in order to verify Customer’ use in compliance with 
this Agreement and/or Orders. HCL may conduct the audit itself or at its option engage an 
independent third party to do such audit, provided that such third party is subject to 
confidentiality obligation consistent with the Agreement. Customer will provide all assistance 
reasonably necessary for HCL to carry out such audit. If the audit reveals underpayment, 
Customer will promptly make such payments. If the audit reveals under-reporting of usage, 
Customer will promptly pay the difference. As with all provisions of the Agreement, HCL’s 
rights and remedies in this paragraph will be without prejudice to other rights and remedies HCL 
has under this Agreement or in any Order, a law or in equity. HCL’s audit rights under this 
paragraph shall survive any termination or expiration of an Order or this CSA for two years. 
b. 
HCL is an independent contractor, not Customer's agent, joint venturer, partner, or fiduciary, and 
does not undertake to perform any of Customer's regulatory obligations or assume any 
responsibility for Customer's business or operations. HCL is an information technology provider 
only. Any directions, suggested usage, or guidance provided by HCL or a Cloud Service does 
not constitute medical, clinical, legal, accounting, or other licensed professional advice. 
Customer and its authorized users are responsible for the use of the Cloud Service within any 
professional practice and should obtain their own expert advice. Customer is responsible for its 
use of HCL and Non-HCL products and services. Each Party is responsible for determining the 
assignment of its and its Affiliates personnel, and their respective contractors, and for their 
direction, control, and compensation. 
c. 
HCL maintains a set of business conduct and related guidelines covering conflicts of interest, 
market abuse, anti-bribery and corruption, and fraud. HCL and its personnel comply with such 
policies and require contractors to have similar policies. 
d. 
HCL, its Affiliates, and contractors of either, may, wherever they do business, store and 
otherwise process business contact information (BCI) of Customer, its personnel and authorized 
users, for example, name, business telephone, address, email, and user ID for business dealings 
with them. Where notice to or consent by the individuals is required for such processing, 
Customer will notify and obtain such consent. The HCL Privacy Policy, available upon request, 
provides additional details with respect to BCI and Account Data described below. 
e. 
Account Data is information, other than Content and BCI, that Customer provides to HCL to 
enable Customer's use of a Cloud Service or that HCL collects using tracking technologies, such 
as cookies and web beacons, regarding Customers use of a Cloud Service. HCL, its Affiliates, 
and contractors of either, may use Account Data for example to enable product features, 
administer use, personalize experience, and otherwise support or improve use of the Cloud 
Service. 
f. 
HCL is not responsible for the acts or omissions of its Business Partners. 
g. 
Neither Party may assign the Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent 
of the other; provided that HCL may assign or delegate its rights and/or obligations or any part 
thereof under this Agreement to any or all of its Affiliates. Assignment of HCL rights to receive 
payments or assignment by HCL in conjunction with the sale of the portion of HCL's business 
that includes a service is not restricted. 
h. 
This CSA applies to HCL and Customer and their respective Affiliates who acquire Cloud 
Services under this CSA. The Parties shall coordinate the activities of their own Affiliates under 
the Agreement. “Affiliates” means an entity that controls, is controlled by, or shares common 

 
 
Page 9 of 9 
control with HCL or Customer, where such control arises from either (i) a direct or indirect 
ownership interest of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting stock and/or 
equivalent interest, or (ii) the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and 
policies, whether through the ownership of voting stock and/or equivalent interest, by contract, 
or otherwise, equal to that provided by a direct or indirect ownership of more than fifty percent 
(50%) of the outstanding voting stock and/or equivalent interest. 
i. 
Except as provided herein, all notices under the Agreement must be in writing and sent to the 
business address specified for the Agreement, unless a Party designates in writing a different 
address. The Parties consent to the use of electronic means and facsimile transmissions for 
communications as a signed writing. Any reproduction of the Agreement made by reliable means 
is considered an original. The Agreement supersedes any course of dealing, discussions or 
representations between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. 
j. 
No right or cause of action for any third party is created by the Agreement or any transaction 
under it. Neither Party will bring a legal action arising out of or related to the Agreement more 
than two years after the cause of action arose. Neither Party is responsible for failure to fulfill its 
non-monetary obligations due to causes beyond its control. Except as provided in Section 8, each 
Party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims the other has not 
met its obligations. Where approval, acceptance, consent, access, cooperation or similar action 
by either party is required, such action will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. 
k. 
HCL may use personnel and resources in locations worldwide, including contractors to support 
the delivery of the Cloud Services. HCL may transfer Content, including personal data, across 
country borders. A list of countries where Content may be processed for a Cloud Service is 
described in the SD. HCL is responsible for its obligations under the Agreement even if HCL 
uses a contractor and will have appropriate agreements in place to enable HCL to meet its 
obligations for a Cloud Service. 
l. 
HCL may offer additional customization, configuration or other services to support Cloud 
Services, as detailed in a SD.

such Services were rendered shall not be due or payable by CBRE.  For valuable 
consideration, the receipt of which is acknowledged by Service Provider, Service Provider 
agrees that failure by Service Provider to invoice for Services within the foregoing sixty 
(60) day period, shall constitute a full and complete release of any claims by Service 
Provider, whether in law or equity, and Service Provider waives its right to pursue any 
action, whether at law or in equity, arising out of this Agreement, against CBRE or Client 
and their  respective officers, shareholders, directors, partners, employees or agents.  All

completed by Service Provider until CBRE has received payment from Client for such 
Services Provider Fees.

other third party engaged by Service Provider which performs a portion of the Services on 
behalf of Service Provider that has not been paid by Service Provider for services rendered.  
The issuance of any joint cheque pursuant to this provision shall not create any contractual, 
third party beneficiary or other relationship between Client, CBRE and such subcontractor 
or third party.  CBRE may offset any amounts paid or incurred to discharge, settle or 
remove any liens, judgments and/or claims arising from the Services of Service Provider

at any time and without cause upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to Service 
Provider.  In the event CBRE’s services have been terminated by Client or CBRE’s 
agreement with Client expires, and either Client or Client’s designee determines to 
continue this Agreement and require Service Provider to continue to perform Services 
hereunder, CBRE will not be subject to any fee, liability or penalty as a result thereof,

provided such cure is promptly, continuously and diligently pursued), CBRE may in its 
discretion thereafter immediately terminate this Agreement and/or any such Statement of 
Work, either in whole or in part with respect to one or more of the Facilities, by written 
notice to Service Provider.  In addition, upon the occurrence of any such Default by Service

of CBRE’s other rights or remedies, and without liability to Service Provider in connection 
therewith, CBRE or its designee may (but shall not be obligated to) perform any such 
covenant, agreement or obligation under this Agreement or any Statement of Work for the

CBRE.  CBRE, however, may withhold any payments due Service Provider upon its 
Default for the purpose of set-off until such time as the exact amount of damages due to 
CBRE from Service Provider is determined.  Termination or expiry of this Agreement shall 
not affect any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities of the parties that have accrued up

Statement of Work, Service Provider shall cooperate for a period of time following such 
expiration or termination to be determined by CBRE to assure the orderly transition of all

and as requested by CBRE: (i) either terminate or assign to CBRE or its designee, at 
CBRE’s option, any or all subcontracts relating to the Services then in effect; and (ii)

or Client’s name or logo, and shall not utilize other trademarks or service marks of CBRE

prescribed by an applicable statute of limitation, then there shall be no requirement that 
such Party utilize the mediation process referred to herein.

other Party, continue performing its obligations under the Agreement while any dispute is

the Term as to all or any part of the Services.

for the proper performance of the Transition Services in accordance with the Statement of 
Work, they shall be deemed to be included within the scope of the Transition Services to be 
delivered for no additional charge, as if such services, functions or responsibilities were 
specifically described in the Transition Plan.  
 
During the Transition Services Period, CBRE will perform those tasks which are designated to 
be CBRE’s responsibility in  the Transition Plan (which shall be deemed to include any services, 
functions or responsibilities not specifically described in the Transition Plan that are an inherent 
or necessary part of, or are required for the proper performance of, what are described in the 
Transition Plan as CBRE responsibilities) provided, however, CBRE shall not be obligated to 
perform any tasks during the Transition Services Period that are not set forth in the Transition 
Plan.  
 
Unless otherwise agreed, CBRE shall not incur any charges, fees or expenses payable to Service 
Provider or third parties in connection with the Transition Services, other than those charges, 
fees and expenses specified in the Statement of Work and those incurred by CBRE in 
connection with its performance of tasks designated in the Transition Plan as CBRE’s 
responsibility. 
 
1.1 
Content of Transition Plan.  
(a) 
the Service Provider shall include in the summary transition plan the following:   
(i) 
a process and set of standards acceptable to CBRE to which Service Provider 
will adhere in the performance of the Transition Services and that will 
enable CBRE to determine whether Service Provider has successfully 
completed the transition and the activities and deliverables associated with 
each Critical  Milestone, in accordance with the acceptance criteria specified 
in the Transition Plan; 
(ii) 
the contingency or risk mitigation strategies to be employed by Service 
Provider in the event of disruption or delay;  
(iii) 
any transition responsibilities to be performed or transition resources to be 
provided by CBRE or the Eligible Recipients; and  
(iv) 
a detailed work plan identifying the specific transition activities to be

Service Provider shall provide all cooperation and assistance reasonably required 
or requested by CBRE in connection with CBRE’s evaluation or testing of the 
deliverables set forth in the Transition Plan.  
(b) 
Service Provider shall perform the Transition Services in a manner so as to avoid 
or minimise to the extent reasonably possible any:  
(i) 
disruption or adverse impact on the business or operations of CBRE or the 
Eligible Recipients;  
(ii) 
degradation of the Services then being received by CBRE or the Eligible 
Recipients;  
(iii) 
disruption or interference with the ability of CBRE or the Eligible 
Recipients to obtain the full benefit of the Services, except as may be 
otherwise provided in the Transition Plan.  
(c) 
Prior to undertaking any transition activity, Service Provider shall discuss with 
CBRE all known specific material risks and shall not proceed with such activity 
until CBRE is reasonably satisfied with the plans with regard to such risks 
(provided, however, that, neither Service Provider’s disclosure of any such risks to 
CBRE, nor CBRE’s acquiescence in Service Provider’s plans, shall operate or be 
construed as limiting Service Provider’s responsibilities under this Agreement or a 
Statement of Work). 
(d) 
Service Provider shall identify and resolve, with CBRE’s reasonable assistance, any 
problems that may impede or delay the timely completion of each task in the 
Transition Plan that is Service Provider’s responsibility and shall use commercially 
reasonable efforts to assist CBRE with the resolution of any problems that may 
impede or delay the timely completion of each task in the Transition Plan that is 
CBRE’s responsibility. 
1.3 
Meetings; Reports.  
(a) 
Service Provider shall meet at least weekly or at such other intervals with CBRE to 
report on its progress in performing its responsibilities and meeting the timetable

include Service Provider Personnel in such meetings as and to the extent appropriate 
or requested by CBRE.  
(b) 
Service Provider also shall provide written reports to CBRE at least weekly, 
regarding such matters, and shall provide oral reports more frequently if reasonably 
requested by CBRE. Promptly upon receiving any information indicating that 
Service Provider may not perform its responsibilities or meet the timetable set forth 
in the Transition Plan, Service Provider shall notify CBRE in writing of material 
delays and shall identify for CBRE’s consideration and approval specific measures 
to address such delay and mitigate the risks associated therewith.  
1.4 
Suspension or Delay of Transition Activities.  
 

 
Exhibit_3_-_Statement_of_Work_2     Page 13 of 15 
  
(a) 
CBRE reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend or delay the performance 
of the Transition Services and/or the transition of any part of the Services under the 
Statement of Work. If CBRE elects to exercise such right, then, to the extent 
CBRE’s decision is based on Service Provider’s failure to perform its obligations 
with respect to the Transition Services under this Agreement or the Statement of 
Work, CBRE shall not incur any additional Charges, Termination Charges or 
reimbursable expenses in connection with such decision.  
(b) 
To the extent CBRE’s decision is not based on Service Provider’s failure to perform 
its obligations under this Agreement or the Statement of Work, CBRE shall, in 
addition to paying any applicable Charges for Services that Service Provider 
continues to provide, reimburse Service Provider for any additional costs 
reasonably incurred by Service Provider as a result of such decision (provided that 
Service Provider notifies CBRE in advance of such costs, obtains CBRE’s approval 
prior to incurring such costs, establishes a reasonable cap on such costs and uses 
commercially reasonable efforts to minimise such costs). 
1.5 
Failure to Meet Critical Transition Milestones.  
The Parties acknowledge and agree that each Transition Plan under a Statement of Work 
may specify various Critical Milestones by which material transition activities and/or 
deliverables are to be completed. If Service Provider fails to meet a ccritical mmilestone, 
Service Provider shall pay CBRE the Deliverable Credits to cover the  lost. Neither the 
Transition Services nor the activities and deliverables associated with individual ccritical 
mmilestones shall be deemed complete until CBRE’s aacceptance of such activities and 
deliverables.  
1.6 
Termination for Cause.  
(a) 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and in addition to any other termination right CBRE 
may have under the Agreement or this Statement of Work, CBRE may terminate 
the Statement of Work in whole or in part for cause if:  
(i) 
Service Provider materially breaches its obligations with respect to the 
provision of Transition Services under the Statement of Work and fails to 
cure such breach within fifteen (15) days after its receipt of notice;  
(ii) 
Service Provider fails to meet a Critical Milestone by the applicable date set 
out in the Transition Plan and Service Provider fails to cure such failure 
within fifteen (15) days after its receipt of notice.  
(b) 
In all such events, CBRE may recover the damages suffered by CBRE or the 
Eligible Recipients in connection with such a termination, provided that, if such a 
termination is based on Service Provider’s failure to meet a Critical Milestone, 
Service Provider shall be entitled to set-off against such damages any Deliverable 
Credits Service Provider has paid for the failure to meet such Critical Milestone.

Exhibit 4 
Pricing  
1. 
General  
In addition to the requirements specified in the Service Agreement, this Exhibit 4 contains 
pricing and financial provisions.  There shall be no charges to CBRE except those expressly 
provided for in this Exhibit 4 or the applicable Statement of Work(s). 
2. 
Assumptions  
(a) 
Service Provider will document any key assumptions affecting price, schedule or 
functionality applicable Statement of Work. If no impacts are specified, then CBRE 
will assume there are none.   
(b) 
Service Provider shall not charge CBRE for on-call or shift differential premiums 
unless otherwise agreed to in a Statement of Work. 
(c) 
Service Provider shall not be entitled to charge for overtime unless agreed by CBRE 
prior to being incurred. 
3. 
Out of Pocket Expenses  
3.1 
Immigration, living and equipment 
Unless otherwise specified in a Statement of Work, the charges include all immigration, 
living and equipment (including laptop and desktop) expenses.  
 
3.2 
Travel  
CBRE shall reimburse Service Provider for Out-of-Pocket Expenses incurred for travel as 
required to perform the Services specified in a Statement of Work provided that:  
(a) 
such expenses (including an estimate of the total cost) have been agreed by the 
Parties in the Statement of Work or in writing prior to such expenses being incurred;  
(b) 
Service Provider complies with applicable CBRE travel expense policies which 
have been notified in writing to Service Provider.  
3.3 
Increases tax costs  
(a) 
The Parties acknowledge and agree that, in certain circumstances, Service Provider 
Personnel performing Services in a single location outside the city, state, province, 
or country in which such Service Provider Personnel are based may incur increased 
tax costs for which they are entitled to be reimbursed by Service Provider.   

 
PRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL 
 
    -2- 
CBRE Service Agreement 30-11-16 (Rev 2) 
 
(b) 
With respect to project work performed by Service Provider on a time & materials 
basis, CBRE agrees to reimburse Service Provider for such increased tax costs if 
and to the extent the applicable Statement of Work expressly provides for such 
reimbursement.  If the applicable Statement of Work does not provide for such 
reimbursement, but CBRE changes the requirements of the time & materials project 
in a manner that prolongs the anticipated involvement of Service Provider 
Personnel then working on the project and thereby triggers the potential for such 
increased tax costs, Service Provider shall so notify CBRE via a Change Request, 
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to propose means of minimising any 
increased tax costs to the extent legally permissible.  If the Parties are unable to 
agree on measures to minimise such increased tax costs and CBRE nonetheless 
wishes to proceed with such changes, CBRE shall reimburse Service Provider for 
such increased tax costs.  In all events, Service Provider shall use commercially 
reasonable efforts to minimise to the extent legally permissible any increased tax 
costs to be reimbursed by CBRE.  For avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise agreed 
in a specific Statement of Work, CBRE shall not be obligated to reimburse Service 
Provider for increased tax costs associated with non-project work or project work 
on a fixed price basis.  
4. 
Non chargeable functions 
The charges shall not include the cost of functions, including overhead functions that are 
provided as part of overall contract management and administration.  Examples of these 
functions include:  
(a) 
performing Service Provider back office functions; 
(b) 
Service Provider account management; 
(c) 
Service Provider managers (excluding project managers, project staff, team 
leaders/supervisors and their immediate managers); 
(d) 
all transition/migration-related activities (e.g., project management, training, 
process implementation, governance, planning, knowledge-transfer) except where 
expressly listed as chargeable in a Statement of Work; 
(e) 
Service Level administration, monitoring, metrics/measurement implementation 
(other than function point counting and administration), and reporting as required 
by the Statement of Work; 
(f) 
resource management or administration, staffing, HR-related functions;

secretaries, promotion, publicity, internal management; 
(i) 
all management reporting to the extent required by the Statement of Work; 
(j) 
all planning-related activities (including technology, business, financial/budget, 
data centre capacity and support);  
(k) 
all activities to train Service Provider Personnel (other than training required by 
CBRE that is specific to CBRE’s businesses and not general to the technology 
supported by Service Provider); 
(l) 
implementation, training of Service Provider Personnel, and customisation of 
standard project management processes and methodologies; 
(m) 
activities and tools implemented by Service Provider either at its discretion or as 
required to meet its obligations under the Statement of Work; 
(n) 
work to develop action plans as a result of any Service Level Default;  
(o)

5. 
Productivity Savings 
 
5.1 
Obligation to cooperate

achieve reductions in the cost of service delivery and corresponding reductions in the 
Charges to be paid by CBRE by modifying or reducing the nature or scope of the 
Services, the applicable Service Levels or other contract requirements.  
5.2 
Cost reduction proposal  
(a) 
If requested by CBRE, Service Provider shall  
(i) promptly prepare a proposal at a level of detail sufficient to permit CBRE 
to make an informed business decision regarding viable ways of 
achieving the desired reductions without adversely impacting business 
objectives or requirements identified by CBRE; 
(ii) give due consideration to any means of achieving such reductions 
proposed by CBRE; and  

 
PRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL 
 
    -4- 
CBRE Service Agreement 30-11-16 (Rev 2) 
 
(iii) negotiate in good faith with CBRE about each requested reduction in 
Charges and, without disclosing the actual cost of providing the Services, 
shall identify for CBRE if and to what extent the cost of service delivery 
may be reduced by implementing various changes in the contract 
requirements.  
 
(b) CBRE shall not be obligated to accept or implement any proposal prepared 
by the Service Provider in accordance with Section 5.2(a) and Service 
Provider shall not be obligated to implement any change that affects the terms 
of this Agreement unless and until such change is reflected in a written 
amendment to this Agreement.

Exhibit 5 
CBRE Service Provider Code of Conduct 
POLICY 7.2.1 SERVICE PROVIDER CODE OF CONDUCT 
 
EFFECTIVE DATE: May 20, 2016 
 
REVISED: 
 
CBRE Group, Inc., including each of its divisions, business units, affiliates and subsidiaries, 
(collectively, “CBRE”) is firmly committed to conducting business with the highest integrity and 
in compliance with the letter and spirit of the law. As an industry leader and a responsible business, 
CBRE seeks to use its position to promote the highest standards for ethics and business conduct 
wherever CBRE operates. As a service provider of products and/or services to CBRE, your 
company (“Service Provider”) is critical to CBRE’s success, and in order for CBRE to provide 
superior services in a responsible manner, CBRE requires Service Provider to comply with this 
Service Provider Code of Conduct (this “Code”). 
 
This Code sets forth CBRE’s fundamental ethical and business conduct requirements for its service 
providers. This Code is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all requirements to be followed by 
Service Provider, but is intended to be a high level overview of such requirements. All references 
in this Code to “Laws” means all applicable laws, regulations, directives, rules, decrees, and 
governmental orders. 
 
Service Provider is responsible for ensuring that their directors, officers, employees, agents, 
representatives, service providers, subcontractors, and other business partners understand, and 
comply with, the requirements set forth in this Code. Service Provider will promptly notify CBRE 
in writing of any known or suspected violation of this Code. 
 
Anti-bribery/Corruption. Service Provider must compete strictly on the basis of the merits of 
their products and services. Service Provider must never offer, promise, authorize, or provide, 
directly or indirectly, anything of value (including, without limitation, business gifts or courtesies) 
with the intent or effect of inducing anyone (including, without limitation, a CBRE customer, 
CBRE employee, or higher tier or sub-tier service provider) to forego their duties and provide 
unfair business advantage to CBRE, Service Provider, or others. Accordingly, Service Provider 
will, and will cause its employees, representatives, and subcontractors to, comply with all Laws 
relating to anticorruption and anti-money laundering in all of the countries in which any affiliated 
business or associate of the Service Provider provides products or services, directly or indirectly, 
and any other countries in which Service Provider conducts business. 
 
Unfair Business Practices. Service Provider must not engage in any illegal anti-competitive 
conduct or deceptive trade practice for any reason whatsoever, whether on behalf of CBRE, 
Service Provider, or others. Accordingly, Service Provider must never rig bids, fix prices, or 
provide or exchange customers, CBRE’s, Service Provider’s, or others’ competitively sensitive 
information (including, without limitation, price, cost, and technical data) with CBRE’s 
competitors or competitors of Service Provider. Service Provider must also refrain from abusing 

PRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL 
 
    -2- 
CBRE Master Service Agreement 30-11-16 (Rev 2) 
 
their market power, whether for their benefit or for the benefit of others, by refusing to deal fairly, 
engaging in predatory or discriminatory pricing practices, conditioning the sale or provision of a 
particular product or service with that of another 
product or service, or undertaking similar abusive tactics. Service Provider must not engage in

“designated employee” or “Consultant” of the Water Authority for the purposes of the Water 

 
8 
Sample Professional Services Contract 
 
 
 
 
 
    
Authority’s Local Conflict of Interest Code and the California Political Reform Act.  This 
contract does not require or permit Contractor to make a governmental decision as specified in 2 
Cal. Code of Regs. § 18701, subdiv. (a)(2)(A), or serve in a staff capacity as specified in 2 Cal. 
Code of Regs.  § 18701, subdiv. (a)(2)(B). 
 
[OPTION 2:  The Water Authority has determined, based on the scope of the services to be 
provided by Contractor under this contract, that this contract confers on Contractor or any of 
Contractor’s employees the status of a “designated employee” or “Consultant” of the Water 
Authority for the purposes of the Water Authority’s Local Conflict of Interest Code and the 
California Political Reform Act.  Contractor will be subject to the same provisions as the 
_________ Designation in the Water Authority’s Local Conflict of Interest Code.  
 
(b) 
Disqualification.  Contractor shall not make or participate in making or in any way 
attempt to use Contractor's position to influence a governmental decision in which Contractor 
knows or has reason to know Contractor has a direct or indirect financial interest other than the 
compensation promised by this contract.  Contractor will not have such interest during the term 
of this contract.  Contractor will immediately advise the General Counsel of the Water Authority 
if Contractor learns of a financial interest of Contractor's during the term of this contract.  If

conflict of interest, in the opinion of the Water Authority, the Water Authority may disqualify 
Contractor from participation in such other project during the term of this Contract.   
 
18. 
INDEMNIFICATION:      
 
(a) 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Contractor shall (1) immediately defend, and 
(2) indemnify the Water Authority, and its directors, officers, and employees from and against all 
liabilities regardless of nature or type arising out of or resulting from Contractor’s performance 
of services under this contract, or any negligent or wrongful act or omission of the Contractor or 
Contractor’s officers, employees, agents, or subcontractors.  Liabilities subject to the duties to 
defend and indemnify include, without limitation all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, 
and judgments; associated investigation and administrative expenses; defense costs, including 
but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees; court costs; and costs of alternative dispute 
resolution. The Contractor’s obligation to indemnify applies unless it is adjudicated that its 
liability was caused by the sole active negligence or sole willful misconduct of an indemnified 
party. If it is finally adjudicated that liability is caused by the comparative active negligence or 
willful misconduct of an indemnified party, the Contractor’s indemnification obligation shall be 
reduced in proportion to the established comparative liability of the indemnified party.   
 
(b) 
The duty to defend is a separate and distinct obligation from the Contractor’s duty to 
indemnify.  The Contractor shall be obligated to defend, in all legal, equitable, administrative, or 
special proceedings, with counsel approved by the Water Authority, the Water Authority and its 
directors, officers, and employees, immediately upon tender to the Contractor of the claim in any 
form or at any stage of an action or proceeding, whether or not liability is established.  An 
allegation or determination of comparative active negligence or willful misconduct by an 
indemnified party does not relieve the Contractor from its separate and distinct obligation to 

 
9 
Sample Professional Services Contract 
 
 
 
 
 
    
defend Water Authority.   The obligation to defend extends through final judgment, including 
exhaustion of any appeals.  The defense obligation includes an obligation to provide independent 
defense counsel if the Contractor asserts that liability is caused in whole or in part by the 
negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified party.  If it is finally adjudicated that 
liability was caused by the sole active negligence or sole willful misconduct of an indemnified 
party, Contractor may submit a claim to the Water Authority for reimbursement of reasonable 
attorneys’ fees and defense costs.  
 
(c) 
The review, acceptance or approval of the Contractor’s work or work product by any 
indemnified party shall not affect, relieve or reduce the Contractor’s indemnification or defense 
obligations. This Section survives completion of the services or the termination of this contract.  
The provisions of this Section are not limited by and do not affect the provisions of this contract 
relating to insurance.

amount of such fee, commission, percentage, brokerage fees, gift, or contingent fee. 
 
22. 
TERMINATION OR ABANDONMENT:

Water Authority’s Rights.  The Water Authority has the right to terminate or abandon any 
portion or all of the work by giving ten (10) days’ written notice.  Upon receipt of a notice of

the date of termination, Contractor shall deliver to Water Authority all work product, whether 
completed or not, as of the date of termination and not otherwise previously delivered.  The 
Water Authority shall pay Contractor for services performed in accordance with this contract 
before the date of termination. If this contract provides for payment of a lump sum for all 
services or by task and termination occurs before completion of the work or any defined task 
which according to the performance schedule was commenced before the notice of termination, 
the fee for services performed shall be based on an amount mutually agreed to by the Water 
Authority and Contractor for the portion of work completed in conformance with this contract 
before the date of termination.  In addition, the Water Authority will reimburse Contractor for

25. 
ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS:  
 
During the course of this contract, communications may occur through sending, receiving or 
exchanging electronic versions of documents and e-mails using commercially available computer 
software and Internet access.    Contractor and the Water Authority acknowledge that the Internet 
is occasionally victimized by the creation and dissemination of so-called viruses, or similar 
destructive electronic programs.  Contractor and the Water Authority view the issues raised by 
these viruses seriously and have invested in document and e-mail scanning software that identify 
and reject files containing known viruses.  Contractor agrees to update its system with the 
software vendor’s most current releases at regular intervals.  Because of the virus scanning 
software, the respective computer systems of the parties may occasionally reject a 
communication.  The parties acknowledge that this occurrence is to be expected as part of the 
ordinary course of business.  Because the virus protection industry is generally one or two steps 
behind new viruses, neither party can guarantee that its respective communications and 
documents will be virus free.  Occasionally, a virus will escape and go undetected as it is passed 
from system to system.  Although each party will use all reasonable efforts to assure that its 
communications are virus free, neither party warrants that its documents will be virus free.  Each 
party agrees to advise the other if it discovers a virus in its respective system that may have been 
communicated to the other party.

Professional Services Agreement 
 
THIS PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”)  is made by and 
between Cornell University, a New York not-for-profit education corporation, (“Cornell”) on behalf of its 
____________________________________________________________________ (“College/Unit”), 
and ____________________________________________________________________ (“Consultant”) 
as of the Effective Date.  
 
For good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows: 
 
1. 
General Purpose. The general purpose of this Agreement is to engage the services of Consultant 
to perform the services and provide the deliverables described in Schedule A (the “Services” or “Scope of 
Services”). The surrounding facts and circumstances are more fully set out in the attached: 
Schedule A (Scope of Services), Schedule B (Project Timetable and Task Description), Schedule C 
(Payment Amount and Schedule), Schedule D (Consultant’s Personnel), and Appendix 1 (Insurance 
Requirements), all of which are incorporated by this reference. 
 
2. 
General Duties of Consultant.  
 
2.1 
Consultant shall perform the Services in accordance with the attached Schedules and in 
accordance with professional standards for performing services of a similar kind. Consultant warrants that 
all persons assigned by Consultant to the performance of this Agreement (or any specified subcontractor) 
are fully qualified to perform the Services required. Cornell has assigned a representative (“Cornell’s 
Representative”) to provide direction to Consultant with respect to the Services. Consultant’s personnel 
who will perform the Services are listed in Schedule D. Consultant may not replace or reassign such 
personnel without the prior written consent of Cornell’s Representative. If applicable, Consultant shall 
replace personnel with a person having at least equivalent experience and qualifications. Cornell shall 
have the right to review and approve such replacement personnel. 
2.2 
Subject to Section 2.1 above, Consultant may assign the performance of any portion of the 
Services to a subcontractor; provided that Consultant shall be fully responsible for any and all acts and 
omissions of any subcontractor in connection with the performance of this Agreement. All terms, 
conditions and requirements of this Agreement will apply without qualification to any services performed 
or goods provided by any subcontractor. 
 
3. 
Period of Performance. Consultant agrees that all Services provided under this Agreement shall 
commence on ________________, 20____ and be completed no later than ________________, 20____ 
(the “Term”). Consultant shall adhere to the timetable in Schedule B unless such period is otherwise 
extended by Cornell in writing. Consultant shall be responsible to Cornell for any damage caused by its 
failure to comply with the timetable. 
 
4. 
Compensation. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Cornell shall pay 
Consultant an amount not to exceed $____________________ in exchange for the Services. The schedule 
of payments is contained in Schedule C. Consultant shall submit all invoices to Cornell Accounts 
Payable, 377 Pine Tree Road, Ithaca, NY 14850 or emailed to dfa-4040_invoice@cornell.edu, referencing 
the purchase order number. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the total amount 
payable by Cornell for the Services will be determined by applying the stated rate of compensation to the 
services actually performed by Consultant. Consultant will not render the Services and Cornell will not be 
required to pay for any services in excess of the amount stipulated above, unless Consultant has first 
secured prior written approval from Cornell through a contract amendment. 
 

Professional Services Agreement -Cornell Rev. 4/28/2025 
2 
5.
Payment Terms. Consultant shall be paid after Cornell’s receipt from Consultant of properly
prepared invoices in accordance with Cornell’s invoicing instructions as further set forth below in this
Section. Cornell may make adjustments to Consultant’s invoice due to shortages, rejection, or other
failure to comply with the provisions of this Agreement. Discount periods, if any, shall commence after
the latest of final acceptance, delivery, receipt of any required documentation, or receipt of invoice.
Delays in receiving the invoice, errors or omissions on the invoice, or lack of supporting documentation
required by the terms of this Agreement will be cause for withholding settlement without losing prompt
payment discount privilege. Invoices must be accompanied by transportation receipt if transportation is
payable as a separate item. Consultant shall submit an original invoice to Cornell promptly after each
shipment, if applicable, in accordance with the instructions on the purchase order. If Consultant elects to
use paper or email invoices, all payments are due either (i) within sixty (60) days following Cornell’s
receipt of the invoice if receiving check payments, or (ii) forty-five (45) days following Cornell’s receipt
of the invoice if Consultant is enrolled to receive direct deposit payments. If Consultant elects to register
for electronic invoicing and direct deposit payments through the Automated Clearing House (ACH), then
all payments are due Net 30 days after the receipt of invoice.
6.
Tax Withholding for Domestic and Foreign Consultants. All payments from Cornell to
Consultant under this Agreement may be subject to tax withholding. Cornell reserves the sole right and
discretion to withhold tax where it believes it is required to do so under the tax laws of any jurisdiction.
By accepting this Agreement, the Consultant is relinquishing all claims against Cornell for any amounts
withheld and remitted by Cornell to a tax authority. It is the Consultant’s sole responsibility to provide
Cornell with timely, complete, accurate, and legible forms and/or documents necessary to claim a
reduction or elimination of withholding taxes (e.g., Form W-8BEN). Cornell reserves the sole right and
discretion to make the determinations as well as whether such forms and/or documents are sufficient to
reduce or eliminate withholding tax on any payment to the Consultant.
7.
Independent Contractor Status. Consultant is an independent contractor and not an employee,
partner, or joint venturer of Cornell. Consultant is not an agent of Cornell, nor is it authorized to transact
business, enter into agreements, or otherwise make commitments on behalf of Cornell, unless expressly
authorized in writing by an authorized representative of Cornell. Cornell will not pay or withhold federal,
state, or local income tax or other payroll tax of any kind on behalf of Consultant or its employees.
Consultant is not eligible for, not entitled to, and shall not participate in any of Cornell’s pension, health,
or other benefit plans. Consultant is solely responsible for the payment of all required payroll taxes,
whether federal, state, or local in nature, including, but not limited to income taxes, Social Security taxes,
Federal Unemployment Compensation taxes, and any other fees, charges, licenses, or payments required
by law.
8.
Use of Cornell Data. Cornell shall retain, as between the parties, exclusive ownership of all data,
material, books, records, and information in any format or medium (including provided orally) submitted
or made available to Consultant by Cornell or by any other person acting on behalf of Cornell
(collectively, “Cornell Data”), unless otherwise publicly available. Subject to terms and conditions
contained in Section 11. Intellectual Property, Consultant is granted a limited, non-transferable, non-
sublicensable, nonexclusive license to use such Cornell Data solely for the purpose of performing its
obligations under this Agreement. Consultant will provide access to Cornell Data only to those Consultant
employees, subcontractors and agents who need to access the data to fulfill Consultant’s obligations under
this Agreement. Consultant shall not access or use Cornell Data to create aggregated or de-identified
data nor use Cornell Data as training data in generative artificial intelligence systems unless
directed by Cornell. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, Consultant will return to Cornell
in a readily usable format, remove, or securely delete or destroy, as directed by Cornell, all Cornell Data.

Professional Services Agreement -Cornell Rev. 4/28/2025 
3 
9.
Access to Data, Response to Legal Demands or Requests for Data.
9.1 
Cornell shall have the right, at all times during the Term of this Agreement, to access, copy and/or 
remove any and all Cornell Data and information from Consultant. In addition, in connection with 
Cornell’s response to an e-discovery request or other legal proceeding, governmental request, or other a 
claim or demand upon receipt of written request from Cornell, Consultant will provide Cornell with any 
existing logs or other Cornell Data and information upon receipt of a written request from Cornell. 
9.2  
If Consultant (a) files a petition seeking to take advantage of any law relating to bankruptcy or 
insolvency, (b) is adjudicated to be bankrupt, (c) is the subject of a petition seeking liquidation, 
reorganization, winding-up, dissolution or adjustment of indebtedness, (d) becomes insolvent or makes an 
assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (e) has a receiver appointed on its behalf, Consultant will return 
in a readily usable format, remove, or destroy, as directed by Cornell, all Cornell Data and information. 
9.3  
Upon receipt of valid legal process (the “Legal Request”) seeking Cornell Data, Consultant will 
attempt to redirect the requesting third party to Cornell and/or request that the third party notify Cornell of 
its Legal Request. If Consultant’s redirecting efforts are unsuccessful, and provided Consultant is not 
prohibited by law from doing so, Consultant will provide commercially reasonable notice to Cornell of 
the Legal Request, prior to disclosure of any Cornell Data, which would include, to the extent permitted 
by law, a copy of the Legal Request received by Consultant from the third party. Consultant will 
thereafter respond to the Legal Request in the time permitted unless Cornell has taken appropriate legal 
steps (e.g., Motion to Quash or Motion for a Protective Order) to stop or limit Consultant’s response. 
9.4 
If any legal process is served on Cornell to which Cornell intends to respond, then Consultant will 
provide Cornell with access to any Cornell Data in Consultant’s possession together with any necessary 
encryption keys. If Cornell is unable to access any Cornell Data using the tools and documentation 
provided by Consultant, then, upon request, Consultant will provide commercially reasonable assistance 
to enable Cornell to obtain the Cornell Data. 
10.
Confidentiality.
10.1 
Consultant shall not directly or indirectly disseminate or otherwise disclose, deliver, or make 
available to any person outside its organization any Confidential Information (as defined below) without 
Cornell’s prior, express, written consent or as otherwise expressly permitted by this Agreement. 
Consultant shall protect Confidential Information with the same degree of care used to protect its own 
proprietary or confidential information from unauthorized use or disclosure, which shall not be less than a 
reasonable degree of care. Consultant shall use Confidential Information solely for purposes of its 
performance of the Services and shall not use Confidential Information for any other purpose without the 
prior written consent of Cornell. Consultant may disclose Confidential Information only to persons within 
its organization who have a need to receive such Confidential Information in order to perform 
Consultant’s obligations under this Agreement and who are bound by confidentiality and non-use 
obligations with respect to the Confidential Information in a manner that is consistent with the terms of 
this Section.  
10.2 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Consultant’s obligations with respect to Confidential Information 
shall not apply to any information that: (a) is or becomes publicly available in a manner not involving 
Consultant’s violation of this Agreement or any other agreement to which Consultant is a party; (b) was 
known to Consultant at the time it was disclosed, other than by previous disclosure by or on behalf of 
Cornell, as evidenced by Consultant’s written records at the time of disclosure; (c) is independently 
developed by Consultant outside the scope of this Agreement without use of or reference to any 
Confidential Information; or (d) is lawfully and in good faith made available to Consultant by third 

Professional Services Agreement -Cornell Rev. 4/28/2025 
4 
persons without the breach of any confidentiality obligation of which Consultant is or reasonable should 
be aware.  
10.3 
As used in this Agreement, the term “Confidential Information” means all information disclosed 
by or on behalf of Cornell to Consultant in connection with this Agreement or Consultant’s performance 
of the Services, whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should 
be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of 
disclosure.Confidential Information includes, without limitation, the terms of this Agreement; work 
performed and deliverables provided by Consultant to Cornell pursuant to this Agreement; Cornell Data; 
Cornell’s scientific, technical, trade or business information; information pertaining to Cornell’s 
information security, physical security, network security, systems security, or staff security; Cornell’s 
business, development, or construction needs, plans, methods, or proposals; and financial information. 
10.4 
If required by law or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, then Consultant may disclose 
Confidential Information to a governmental authority, provided that Consultant shall: (i) make reasonable 
efforts to give Cornell notice of such requirement prior to disclosure (which must include a copy of any 
applicable subpoena or order) in order to permit Cornell to obtain, at its own expense, protective 
treatment of such Confidential Information and (ii) limit the disclosure only to such portion of the 
Confidential Information that it is required by law or such court order to disclose. If Consultant breaches 
its confidentiality obligations, Cornell shall have all rights available to it at law and in equity to enforce 
the provisions in this Section including, but not limited to, applying to a court of competent jurisdiction 
for specific performance and/or injunctive relief.  
10.5 
The obligations of this Section shall expressly survive the expiration or earlier termination of this 
Agreement. 
11.
Intellectual Property.
11.1. 
Ownership.
11.1.1. Cornell shall own all information, deliverables, and other work product developed, created, 
produced, or otherwise obtained by Consultant pursuant to this Agreement. 
11.1.2. Any copyrightable work (“Work”) developed in the course of Consultant’s performance under 
this Agreement shall be deemed “work made for hire” under federal copyright law and all interests in 
such Work shall belong to Cornell. To the extent any such Work does not constitute a “work made for 
hire” under copyright law, Consultant hereby grants, transfers, assigns, and conveys to Cornell and its 
successors and assigns the entire right, title, and interest in the Work or any part of the Work, including 
but not limited to, the right to: reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute by sale, license or other 
transfer, perform publicly, display, and to secure copyrights or patents and renewals, reissues, and 
extensions of any such copyrights or patents in the United States of America or any foreign country. 
11.1.3. Any patentable invention conceived or reduced to practice in the course of Consultant’s 
performance under this Agreement shall be the property of Cornell, and Cornell has the right to secure 
patents, reissues, and extensions of the same in the United States of America or any foreign country. 
Whether a copyright or patent in the Work will be maintained or registered in the United States of 
America or any foreign country shall be at the sole discretion of Cornell. 
11.1.4. Consultant agrees to cooperate fully with Cornell in the preparation and execution of all 
documents necessary or incidental to the assignment in this Section and the protection 
and preservation of rights herein granted to Cornell. The obligations of this Section shall 

 
Professional Services Agreement -Cornell Rev. 4/28/2025 
 
 
5 
expressly survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement. 
 
11.1.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Consultant owns and shall retain ownership to all of its pre-
existing intellectual property, including all rights, title, and interest to inventive intellectual property 
conceived or acquired by Consultant external to or pre-dating this Agreement consistent with U.S. patent 
law (“Background IP”). Consultant agrees that Cornell may use Consultant’s Background IP in 
connection with the Services. Consultant hereby grants to Cornell a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, 
non-terminable, fully transferable, royalty-free, fully paid up right and license to use any Background IP 
incorporated into the Services or any deliverable. All Services and deliverables exclusive of Consultant’s 
Background IP shall be owned by Cornell to the extent such remainder is functionally separable. Nothing 
in this Agreement shall restrict Cornell from owning any ideas, concepts, know-how, techniques, or 
experience developed by its personnel while carrying out the Services under this Agreement. This 
Agreement does not give Consultant any rights, implied or otherwise, information, or intellectual 
property, except as expressly stated in this Agreement.  
 
11.1.6. If Consultant includes third-party owned assets in the deliverables (“Third-Party Assets”), 
Consultant shall obtain all licenses for such Third-Party Assets from the rights holder for inclusion in the 
deliverables. Upon Cornell’s request, Consultant will provide Cornell with the source from which it 
obtained such Third-Party Assets and, as an alternative, Cornell may request to negotiate and obtain 
licenses directly from the source of the Third-Party Assets if deemed necessary by Cornell. 
 
11.2. 
Non-infringement Warranty. Consultant warrants and represents that the Services and all work 
provided under this Agreement will not infringe, individually or collectively, any patent, copyright, trade 
secret, or other proprietary right of any third party; and Consultant has no reason to believe that any 
patent, copyright, trade secret, or other proprietary right of any third party may be infringed by 
Consultant’s provision of the Services and any work under this Agreement.  
 
12. 
Termination.  
 
12.1 
Termination for Convenience. Cornell may terminate this Agreement at any time without cause 
upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to Consultant.  
 
12.2 
Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice for 
the following reasons:  
 
(i)  the other party’s non-performance or other breach of the Agreement if not cured within thirty (30) 
days. 
 
(ii) Conflict of Interest between a Cornell employee and Consultant. For purposes of this Agreement, a 
“Conflict of Interest” may be deemed present if, in Cornell’s reasonable judgment, a Cornell employee 
who reviews, approves, or administratively manages this Agreement and/or a member of such Cornell 
employee’s family has a significant financial interest in the Consultant, is directly involved in performing 
obligations under this Agreement on behalf of Consultant, or receives any personal financial advantage or 
compensation from this transaction. In this Section, the terms “family” and “significant financial interest” 
have the same meaning as defined in the university conflicts of interest policy. 
 
(iii) In the event of any suspension of payment or the institution of any proceedings by or against the 
other party voluntary or involuntary, in bankruptcy or insolvency, or under the provisions of the Federal 
Bankruptcy Act, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or an assignee for the benefit of creditors 
of the property of the other party.

13. 
Effect of Termination. In the event of termination, Consultant is obligated to provide Cornell 
with copies of any and all Work in progress and complete Work created in the course and scope of this 
Agreement on or before the date of termination. Except in the event of termination for cause, Consultant 
shall be entitled to payment for Services performed to the satisfaction of Cornell prior to termination, if 
any, and explicitly waives any right to additional or other amounts of any kind, including based on 
quantum meruit or other similar theory. 
 
14. 
Indemnification. Consultant shall release, defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Cornell and its 
trustees, officers, agents, and employees from all liability, suits, actions, or claims of any character, name, 
or description including reasonable attorneys’ fees, brought on account of any injuries or damage, or loss 
(real or alleged) received or sustained by any person, persons, or property, arising out of the Services or 
any other work provided under this Agreement, and/or Consultant’s failure to perform or comply with any 
requirements of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claims for personal injury, property 
damage, breach of warranty, or infringement of copyright, patent, or other proprietary right. Consultant 
indemnifies Cornell, and its agents, officers, employees and trustees, and holds each harmless against any 
fines, damages, assessments, or attorney fees in the event a court or administrative agency shall find that 
Consultant or anyone or entity engaged through Consultant is an employee of Cornell. Cornell reserves 
the right to retain whatever funds which would be due to Consultant under this Agreement until such 
suits, action or actions, claim or claims for injuries or damages as aforesaid are settled and satisfactory 
evidence to that effect furnished. These obligations shall expressly survive the expiration or earlier 
termination of this Agreement.  
 
15. 
Insurance.  
 
15.1.  Insurance Coverages. Consultant shall procure and carry insurance to financially support 
indemnification of Cornell as provided herein, and shall provide certificates of such insurance, upon 
request. Annual automatic renewals of the certificate(s) of insurance must be requested from the 
Consultant’s insurance carrier and sent to Cornell upon the annual expiration date of the insurance 
policies. For the Term of the Agreement, Consultant shall procure, at its sole cost and expense, the 
insurance coverages in Appendix 1, Insurance Requirements. 
 
15.2.  Other Insurance-Related Requirements. 
 
15.2.1. The limits of insurance stated in Appendix 1 for each type of insurance are minimum limits only; 
if any policy provided by Consultant provides limits greater than those stated, then the additional insureds 
will be entitled to the full limits of such policy and this Agreement shall be deemed to require such full 
limits. Except with respect to Professional Liability, all policies shall contain a waiver of subrogation. 
Consultant shall be responsible for all deductibles under its policies and all defense costs if its policies do 
not cover such expenses. 
 
15.2.2. All policies required to be maintained shall be issued by an insurance company licensed or 
authorized to do business in New York State with a rating of A- VII or better by A.M. Best. 
 
15.2.3. All contractors and subcontractors used by the Consultant to provide Services under this 
Agreement shall be required to comply with the insurance requirements in this Agreement. 
 
15.2.4. Insurance coverage in the minimum amounts shall not relieve the Consultant or any of its 
subcontractors of any liability, nor shall it preclude Cornell from exercising any rights or taking such 
other actions as are available to it under the law. 
 

Professional Services Agreement -Cornell Rev. 4/28/2025 
7 
15.2.5. A Certificate of Insurance is required evidencing all coverages outlined above prior to 
commencement of work. Further, each policy shall contain provisions giving Cornell at least 30 days 
written (10 days in the case of non-payment) notice of cancellation, non-renewal, or other change in 
coverage. 
15.2.6. Cornell reserves the right to require additional coverage or to increase limits depending upon the 
liability exposure in the scope of work in this Agreement. 
15.2.7. Cornell’s failure to enforce these requirements shall not be considered a waiver of the 
requirements. Any changes to these requirements shall only be made in writing and agreed upon by all 
parties. 
15.2.8.  Consultant shall not do or permit anything to be done that would invalidate the insurance policies 
required herein. 
16.
Compliance with Applicable Laws and University Policies. The Consultant is subject to 
applicable Cornell University regulations and policies, and all applicable federal, state, and local laws and 
regulations. Further, Consultant, its employees, contractors and agents shall act at all times in a 
professional and ethical manner, and shall not engage in harassing, retaliatory, or discriminatory behavior 
of any kind. If Consultant violates any of these obligations or otherwise engages in behavior on Cornell 
property that is considered to be detrimental to students or Cornell, or for any other reason in Cornell’s 
sole discretion, Cornell shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without prior notice. Prior to 
gaining access to Cornell’s facilities in order to perform Services, Consultant personnel will execute 
Cornell’s document(s) required for access privileges and at all times act in compliance with Cornell’s 
policies and procedures. Consultant and all individuals assigned by Consultant to a project under this 
Agreement must comply with Cornell policies.
17.
Equal Employment Opportunity. If Consultant is a federal subcontractor for Cornell, upon 
request Consultant will provide to Cornell a copy of its written polic(ies) or other documentation to 
comply with Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 503) and the Vietnam Era Veterans 
Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA) and implementing federal regulations.
18.
Advertisement. Consultant may not use the name Cornell or any variation of the Cornell name, 
including logos and trademarks of any kind, or those of any of Cornell’s colleges, divisions, departments, 
or programs, for advertising or publicity purposes without first obtaining the written consent of Cornell in 
each instance.
19.
Inspection and Right to Audit. Cornell shall at all times have access to review the ongoing work 
of Consultant for purposes of inspecting the same and determining that the Services are being performed 
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Throughout the Term of this Agreement, and for a period 
of three years after the later of final payment, expiration or termination, or longer if required by law, 
Cornell, at its own expense, shall be entitled to perform, or to have performed by a third party of Cornell’s 
choosing, during normal business hours and upon ten (10) days’ notice, an on-site audit of any and all 
relevant records of Consultant necessary to permit Cornell to evaluate and verify Consultant’s compliance 
with the requirements of this Agreement. Consultant grants Cornell permission to view and/or copy any 
books, documents, records, data, and information (including data and information stored in electronic 
form) of Consultant which relate to or have been used in connection with the performance of this 
Agreement. Consultant also grants Cornell permission to interview Consultant’s staff and agents as part of 
the audit. If applicable, Consultant agrees to provide Cornell with adequate and appropriate workspace for 
conducting the audit. If Cornell, in its sole discretion, determines that an on-site audit is not necessary, 
Consultant agrees to complete, within thirty (30) days of receipt, an audit questionnaire provided by

Professional Services Agreement -Cornell Rev. 4/28/2025 
8 
Cornell. Consultant shall refund to Cornell any overcharges discovered by Cornell, or by a third party of 
Cornell’s choosing, within thirty (30) days following Consultant’s acceptance of Cornell’s written 
notification of audit findings. Consultant may not unreasonably withhold or delay acceptance of audit 
findings. Consultant shall include this audit provision in any subcontracts that it may issue under this 
Agreement. 
20.
FERPA and HIPAA Compliance.
20.1. 
FERPA. To the extent that performance of the Services under this Agreement involves disclosure 
to Consultant of personally identifiable information from student education records protected by the 
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (“Student Information”), the following obligations 
shall apply. Consultant acknowledges that for the purposes of this Agreement, it will be designated as a 
“school official” with “legitimate educational interests” in the Student Information, as those terms have 
been defined under FERPA and its implementing regulations, and Consultant agrees to abide by the 
limitations and requirements imposed by 34 CFR 99.33(a) on school officials. Consultant will use Student 
Information only for the specific purpose of fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement. Consultant 
may not disclose Student Information to or share any Student Information with any other party or for any 
other purpose without the prior written consent of the student. Without limiting the foregoing, Consultant 
will not use such information for Consultant’s own benefit or engage in “data mining” of Cornell Data or 
communications, whether through automated or human means, except as necessary to fulfill its specific 
obligations under this Agreement. Consultant agrees that prior to releasing any Student Information to any 
subcontractor or agent, Consultant will require such subcontractor or agent to agree in writing to terms 
substantively similar to the obligations in this Section. Promptly following the termination or expiration 
of this Agreement, Consultant shall return to Cornell or certify in writing to Cornell the destruction of all 
Student Information (including that provided to or obtained by its subcontractors or agents) disclosed to 
Consultant in connection with this Agreement.  
20.2. 
HIPAA. If Cornell determines that Consultant’s performance under this Agreement requires 
compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Consultant agrees to 
enter into any and all additional documents or amendments Cornell deems necessary to address HIPAA 
compliance, including, without limitation, a Business Associate Agreement in substantially the form 
provided by Cornell. 
21.
Compliance with Personal Data Protection and Privacy Laws. Consultant will comply in all
respects with applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy and the collection, processing, and use of
personal data, including those of the United States and any other country to the extent applicable to the
processing of personal data under this Agreement (together, the “Privacy Laws”). Consultant agrees to
process personal data for which Cornell is the controller (as defined under any applicable Privacy Law)
only to the extent necessary to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and to implement and
maintain appropriate technical and administrative safeguards (as defined in the applicable Privacy Laws)
to prevent the unauthorized access, use or disclosure of such data. Consultant further agrees to allow
Cornell staff or representatives to examine such measures upon request, and to take all reasonable steps to
ensure the reliability of any Consultant personnel who will have access to personal data. Without
prejudice to Consultant’s obligations set out above, Consultant will report to Cornell within forty-eight
(48) hours any loss, damage, or destruction of any personal data processed under this Agreement for
which Cornell is a controller, regardless of whether such personal data constitutes Cornell Data. If
required or deemed advisable for compliance with the Privacy Laws, then Cornell and the Consultant
agree to execute Cornell’s Personal Data Processing Agreement (PDPA) or other required documentation
under applicable Privacy Laws. For purposes of this Section, “personal data” means information relating
to an identified or identifiable individual, and an “identifiable individual” means one who can be
identified, directly or indirectly, by use of any identifier or characteristic specific to that individual.

22. 
Export Control Compliance. Consultant acknowledges that it is subject to U.S. export control 
laws and regulations (collectively, “Export Control Laws”), which include (without limitation) the 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), and 
regulations and orders administered by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(“OFAC Regulations”). Consultant agrees to comply with all Export Control Laws. Consultant shall not 
disclose any technology or technical data subject to Export Control Laws unless and until a plan for the 
transfer, use, dissemination, and control of the information has been approved in writing by Cornell’s 
Export Control Office. Furthermore, Consultant represents and warrants that it is not an entity or 
individual identified on, or owned by a party identified on, any denied or restricted party list under Export 
Control Laws. 
 
23. 
Force Majeure. A Party shall be excused from liability for its failure or delay in performance of 
an obligation under this Agreement to the extent the failure or delay results from causes beyond that 
party’s reasonable control including, but not limited to, a fire, a flood, an explosion, an earthquake, a 
natural disaster or any other act of God, as well as a pandemic, an epidemic, a recognized health threat as 
determined by any federal, state or local government or quasi-governmental authority (including the 
federal Centers for Disease Control), civil unrest, a strike or labor disturbance, war or threat of war, 
terrorism or a threat of terrorism, a governmental or quasi-governmental order or directive to “shelter in 
place”, or any other event, occurrence, order or directive similar to those enumerated above (each, a 
“Force Majeure Event”). A Force Majeure Event may also include a then-current order, policy, rule or 
regulation imposed by Cornell University based upon the health and safety of its student body, faculty, 
staff and/or broader community. A party seeking to rely on this provision shall (i) use reasonable diligence 
to remove the condition that prevents performance and shall not be entitled to suspend performance of its 
obligations in any greater scope or for any longer duration than is required by the Force Majeure event, 
(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of such Force Majeure Event, remedy 
its inability to perform, and resume full performance of its obligations under this Agreement, and (iii) 
promptly provide notice of failure or delay in performance due to a Force Majeure Event to the other 
party, including anticipated impact on performance and efforts to mitigate the failure or delay. The party 
shall provide such notice within ten (10) days prior to the required performance unless the circumstances 
and/or conditions giving rise to the Force Majeure Event necessitate a shorter notice period. 
 
24. 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley. Consultant represents that its management and storage of Cornell Data 
shall in all respects, including, without limitation, administrative, physical and technical aspects, meet the 
privacy and security standards set forth in Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. sections 6801-6809 
(“GLBA”) and its implementing regulations. Without representing that it is subject to GLBA, Consultant 
understands that it may have access under this Agreement to Cornell financial information and other 
nonpublic personal information protected by law. To assist Cornell in meeting Cornell’s GLBA 
obligations, Consultant will implement, maintain, and use appropriate administrative, technical, and 
physical security measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of all electronically maintained or 
transmitted Cornell Data. 
 
25. 
Notices. All notices given or required to be given pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing 
and shall be deemed sufficient upon: (i) personal delivery; (ii) delivery by email with confirmation of 
receipt; or (iii) the third business day after first class certified mailing, in each case to the addresses first 
written above or to such other address as may be specified in writing by the parties for notice purposes. 
 
26. 
Effective Date. The effective date of this Agreement shall be the later of the two dates of 
signature below. 
 

 
Professional Services Agreement -Cornell Rev. 4/28/2025

27. 
Waiver. A delay or failure by either party to exercise any right under this Agreement will not 
constitute a waiver of that or any similar or future right. 
 
28. 
Authority; Binding Agreement. Each party warrants that: (a) it has all requisite power and the 
authority to enter into this Agreement; (b) it is not under, and will not enter into, any obligation to any 
person or entity, contractual or otherwise, that is conflicting or inconsistent in any material respect with 
the terms of this Agreement or that would impede the diligent and complete fulfillment of its obligations 
under this Agreement; and (c) entering into this Agreement is not restricted or prohibited by any existing 
agreement to which it is a party. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the 
parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns. 
 
29. 
Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or 
unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the 
remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. 
 
30. 
Assignment. Consultant may not assign, transfer, or delegate any of or all of its rights or 
obligations under this Agreement, voluntarily or involuntarily, including by change of control, merger, 
operation of law, or any other manner, without the express prior written permission of Cornell. Any 
purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section shall be null and void. 
 
31. 
Governing Law; Dispute Resolution; Jurisdiction. This Agreement will be interpreted under, 
and be governed by, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. 
The parties shall strive to settle amicably, in good faith, and with due diligence any dispute arising from 
or relating to this Agreement. The parties agree if such attempts to resolve a dispute are unsuccessful, then 
any claims, suits, actions, or proceedings between the parties arising in whole or in part under or in 
connection with this Agreement will be brought in the state courts of Tompkins County, New York or the 
federal district court for the Northern District of New York. Each party irrevocably consents to personal 
jurisdiction and exclusive venue in such courts and waives any related claim of improper forum. 
 
32. 
Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including all incorporated appendices, exhibits, and 
attachments, represents the entire understanding of the parties and may not be modified except by written 
agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior written and/or oral agreements. Any terms or conditions 
on Consultant’s quote, invoice, statement of work, or other similar document related to this Agreement, 
including any online terms or click-through agreements, are expressly rejected and are deemed void. This 
Agreement may be executed in counterpart signatures. In the event of a conflict between the terms in this 
Agreement and the terms of any other agreement, including a purchase order, the terms in this Agreement 
shall control.

Contractor prior to the effective date of termination, provided, 
however, that such payment shall not exceed the total Contract

regulations or professional standards. Purchaser may terminate 
this Contract for Force Majeure, by not less than ten (10)

Contractor shall be entitled to be paid for Service properly 
performed by Contractor prior to the effective date of 
termination, provided, however, that such payment shall not 
exceed the total Contract Price after adjustment to account for 
the price associated with Services not performed. Contractor 
shall not be allowed, and expressly waives, payment for profit 
on Services that were not performed as of the termination date. 
18.03 
Termination for Default: If Contractor materially 
fails to provide the Services in accordance with the period 
specified or in the manner required under the Contract; or if the 
Services do not conform to the requirements under the Contract; 
or if the Contractor becomes insolvent or unable to meet its 
payment obligations when due, or breaches any material 
obligation under the Contract, the Purchaser shall give the 
Contractor a written notice describing the instances of default 
and giving the Contractor a reasonable opportunity to cure.  
If the Contractor does not cure the default within the period 
specified in the written notice, the Purchaser may, without 
prejudice to any other rights available to it by law, terminate the 
Contract for default by written notice, specifying the reason for 
the default, the portion(s) of the Contract defaulted and the 
effective date of default.

Order 13224 sanctions list and the United Kingdom terrorist

Termination for Default upon written or oral notice to the 
Contractor. 
In the event of a termination for default, Contractor shall be 
entitled to be paid for Services properly performed prior to the 
effective date of termination, provided, however, that such 
payment shall not exceed the total Contract Price after 
adjustment to account for the price associated with work not 
performed.  Contractor shall not be allowed, and expressly 
waives, payment for profit on Services which were not 
performed as of the termination date.

any contract award valued at and over US $250,000, the World 
Bank Group reserves the right to publicly disclose contract 
award information – specifically, in relation to the Contractor, the 
name of the Contractor receiving the contract and its country, a

the Services.

Contractor has an unfair advantage to compete in the relevant 
bidding process as a result of providing the Services subject of 
this Contract. In those cases, Contractor shall obtain written 
consent to provide the assignment from Purchaser. The 
Purchaser shall not unduly withhold consent unless there is an

31. BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION 
31.01 
Prior to employing individuals or Subcontractors to

Contractor agrees, at its own expense, to perform or cause to 
be performed in accordance with applicable laws the following 
background investigation, and to maintain, or cause to be 
maintained, for 7 years, the results of the investigation in its 
employee’s and its Subcontractor’s employee file: 
(a) Criminal records search over the last seven (7) years, with 
such search being conducted in all jurisdictions where a 
Social Security check indicated the individual worked and 
jurisdictions where the individual indicated maintaining 
residence or going to school; and 
(b) Employment history verification, including dates of 
employment, performance, salary, job title, eligibility for re-
hire, etc., and verification of Social Security numbers to 
ensure they are valid and issued in the corresponding 
name.  Contractor shall represent and warrant that it has 
performed the requested record searches and verifications 
and that, on that basis, its employees and its 
Subcontractors’ employees assigned to work on the 
Purchaser premises: (a) have not been convicted of a 
criminal offense (felony or misdemeanor) during the last 
seven (7) years; (b) are not listed on the National Sex 
Offender Registry; (c) do not have pending criminal 
proceedings; (d) have not been convicted for violations 
(including traffic violations) that would be relevant to 
performance of employment; and (f) have a valid Social 
Security number or work permit.  Should a Contractor

aforementioned standard prior to requesting renewal of 
Purchaser-issued ID card.

consent.

to become due to it hereunder, Contractor shall provide the

Contractor also hereby agrees, notwithstanding the terms of any 
such assignment, that the Purchaser may apply payments owed 
to an assignee to set-off or recoupment for any present or future 
claim or claims which the Purchaser may have against the 
Contractor.  The Purchaser reserves the right to make direct 
settlements or adjustments in price or both, with Contractor 
under the terms of this Contract and without notice to any 
assignee.  Contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless the 
Purchaser against any liability that may arise as a result of such 
assignment.
